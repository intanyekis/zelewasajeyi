In the aftermath, they discover they’re werewolves, and develop an intense bond together,” the synopsis reads. “The two team up, and encounter two other teenagers, the adoptive children of a park ranger, who went through a similar strange wildfire sixteen years ago.”</p><p>In July 2022, creator <strong>Jeff Davis</strong> opened up about getting to work with Gellar on the project.</p><p>“Everyone knows that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a huge influence on Teen Wolf,” the writer said during a panel for Teen Wolf at San Diego Comic Con. “So I always thought it would be amazing if we could bring Sarah Michelle Gellar back to a horror show.”</p><p>The horror icon, who made a surprise appearance at the convention, added, “Everything these guys have been saying about family and the atmosphere of Jeff’s shows is really true. I hope you guys come join us!”</p><p>Gellar’s <a href=#>role in Wolf Pack marks her return to television</a> after previously starring in hit shows including <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, Ringer and The Crazy Ones. She has also appeared in <a href=#>I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>, the <a href=#>Scooby Doo</a> film franchise, <a href=#>Cruel Intentions</a> and Southland Tales.</p><p>In the upcoming series, Gellar plays an arson investigator Kristin Ramsey who gets caught up in the supernatural activities around her. According to Paramount+, the character is “a highly regarded expert in her field and no stranger to personal loss, brought in by authorities to catch the teenage arsonist who started a massive wildfire which may have also led to the reawakening of a supernatural predator terrorizing Los Angeles.”</p><p>Along with Wolf Pack, the streaming service <a href=#>is also set to release a Teen Wolf revival movie</a>. The upcoming film will <a href=#>bring back many fan-favorite characters from the original series</a> including <a href=#><strong>Tyler Posey</strong></a> (Scott McCall), <a href=#><strong>Holland Roden</strong></a> (Lydia Martin), <strong>Melissa Ponzio</strong> (Melissa McCall), <strong>Seth Gilliam</strong> (Dr. Alan Deaton), <strong>Linden Ashby</strong> (Sheriff Noah Stilinski) and <strong>JR Bourne</strong> (Chris Argent).</p><p>Additionally, <a href=#><strong>Colton Haynes</strong></a> (Jackson Whittemore), <strong>Ryan Kelley</strong> (Deputy Jordan Parrish), <strong>Shelley Hennig</strong> (Malia Tate), <strong>Orny Adams</strong> (Coach Bobby Finstock) and<strong> Dylan Sprayberry</strong> (Liam Dunbar) will <a href=#>also be returning after being featured</a> in the MTV series <a href=#>during its run from 2011 to 2017.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During the SDCC panel, fans got a glimpse at the trailer, which included a shocking return from <a href=#><strong>Crystal Reed</strong></a>, whose character <a href=#>Allison Argent tragically died in season 3</a>.</p><p>Scroll down for everything to know about Wolf Pack:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bpsqa6jLCmpZ6jYsSwuMVmp5qbm2Kyt7HRsquhoZ6cerW7jKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmq6GdXai1sMOO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
