I can do this,” Alissa McCommon, a fourth-grade teacher, can be heard saying in an alleged phone call with the victim. A recording of the call was played aloud in a Tipton County courtroom Tuesday, <a href=#>according to WMC-TV.</a></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">McCommon, 38, of Covington, Tennessee, is accused of sexually assaulting a boy while he was spending the night at her home in 2021. The boy was 12 at the time.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">McCommon was<a href=#> arrested on Sept. 8 </a>and charged with rape. <a href=#>She was rearrested on Sept. 28</a> and charged with coercing, harassing and stalking the boy.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She had been released on $250,000 bond, but her bond was revoked after McCommon allegedly contacted the boy.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“[T]he actions of McCommon are not only appalling, but CPD is also concerned about this apparent violation of her bond conditions,” Covington Police Chief Donna Turner said in a Sept. 28 statement.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Prosecutors played the call in open court almost a week after Covington police said McCommon violated the terms of her bond from a child rape charge after texting the victim,<a href=#> according to WREG-TV.</a></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I will never text you again,” McCommon allegedly said during the phone call. “You will never hear from me again. Just please don’t say anything. I’m under so much stress and I’m so scared all the time.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I tried to tell you. When it comes out looking like you, we don’t have to talk anymore. Just please God, tell me you’re not going to say anything. I’ll never speak to you again.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">McCommon’s attorney, Jere Mason, said that there’s limited proof that the woman in the phone conversation is his client.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“You have to go off... what is the actual proof? There was no witness that was presented as a victim or anyone like that to testify this was her,” Mason said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Mason said police also didn’t have the phone or registration of the number to find where the threatening texts came from either.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Obviously this is going to be a trying issue for victims and everybody involved, families,” Mason said. “It’s also a trying issue for the defendant. She’s under a lot of pressure. A lot of stress.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">McCommon’s next court date is Nov. 27.</p><p>Latest trending news:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKyimrultc2gZq2dkZi1pr6MmpqcraOasW6%2BwKmgp59dqMG2sMSnq2ahnaW5qrHSZqqhnaNivbOxxqeYp6xdrLa1tIyhoKxlk522rbCOjX%2BJhIprmo%2BAsXx6i3yIfp14pbmCe46ChYJ8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
