Despite the criticism, Larsa told <strong>Tamron Hall</strong> that their romance wasn’t planned and it just happened.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The lovebirds recently opened up about the possibility of having a family in the future and admitted there have been “conversations” about it.&nbsp; Larsa is already the mother of four kids, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three sons, </a><strong>Scotty Pippen Jr</strong>, 22,&nbsp;<strong>Preston Pippen</strong>, 21, and&nbsp;<strong>Justin Pippen</strong>, 18, and a daughter, <strong>Sophia Pippen</strong>, 14, all of whom she shares with Scottie. “I think there’s [mostly] been conversations around it,” Marcus said about future kids on the June 20 episode of their podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Separation Anxiety with Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/michael-jordan-larsa-pippen-marcus-jordan-spl-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“When we go and we meet people, or I’m introducing you to some of my friends, or you introduce me to some of your friends I feel like it gets brought up,” he continued when talking to Larsa. “But I feel like we’ve never had a one-on-one, private <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>conversation</a> about having children.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“It’s one of those things where I think time will tell,” Larsa replied. “I feel like I’m happy, because I have four kids, and I feel like you don’t have kids, so basically it’d be a question for you.
