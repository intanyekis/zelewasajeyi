A judge ordered on Wednesday that the Canadian rapper be subjected to house arrest and electronic monitoring until the trial, which is scheduled to start at the end of November.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A Los Angeles judge has ruled that Tory Lanez should be placed under house arrest, TMZ and CBS News Los Angeles report. The rapper and singer is facing assault and weapons charges after allegedly shooting Megan Thee Stallion in 2020. (Lanez has pleaded not guilty.) He will be under house arrest, starting this Friday, October 31, until the next court date. The trial is currently scheduled to begin on the morning of Monday, November 28.</p><p>Los Angeles police initially reported the incident only as shots fired, a woman with foot injuries, and a man arrested on a weapons allegation.</p><p>But Pete revealed a few days later that her foot injuries came from gunshots, and a month later said in an Instagram video it was Lanez who fired them. She slowly revealed more via social media in subsequent weeks.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Megan Thee Stallion Says Tory Lanez Offered Hush Money After Shooting Her</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The way people have publicly questioned and debated whether I played a role in my own violent assault proves that my fears about discussing what happened were, unfortunately, warranted,” she wrote in an op-ed for <a href=#><i>The New York Times.</i></a></p><p>The day after he was charged, Lanez tweeted "the truth will come to the light" and "a charge is not a conviction."</p><p>In April 2022, Lanez was handcuffed and taken into custody for violating a protective order preventing him from contacting or harassing Megan Thee Stallion, 27, or sharing pretrial information from the case.
