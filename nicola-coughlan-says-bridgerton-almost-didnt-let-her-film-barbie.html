I didn’t know they’d put me on a poster. All that was very surprising to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nicola-Coughlan-Says-Bridgerton-Almost-Didnt-Let-Her-Film-Barbie-3.jpg><p>Coughlan previously spoke on the scheduling conflict, though she didn’t disclose at the time that it was Bridgerton that kept her from a larger role in Barbie.</p><p>“When I found out [<strong>Greta Gerwig</strong>] wanted to have me be part of @barbiethemovie, and then that I probably wouldn’t be able to make it work because of my schedule I was firstly elated and quickly heartbroken,” Coughlan explained in <a href=# rel=noopener>an Instagram post</a> last July. “So when I was asked if I wanted to pop into Barbieland even briefly my answer was an immediate, and very emphatic yes.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nicola-Coughlan-Says-Bridgerton-Almost-Didnt-Let-Her-Film-Barbie-4.jpg><p>Coughlan broke out in her role as Clare Devlin on British sitcom Derry Girls, which premiered in 2018. She was then cast as Penelope Featherington on Bridgerton, a role she has played since 2020. The first half of Bridgerton season 3 is due to release on May 16, with the second half coming June 13.</p><p>Again showing her versatility, Coughlan is working on more than just Bridgerton right now. She’s also starring in the six-part comedy series Big Mood, which premieres this week in Ireland.</p><p>“I’m so insanely proud of it,” Coughlan <a href=# rel=noopener>told the Irish Mirror</a>. “It’s the most personally invested I’ve ever been in anything that I’ve ever worked on. Because it is written by one of my best friends and it’s got so much meaning behind it. I think it’s so funny.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKWim5%2Bhrm6vzq6eoaSRo3q0rdisZJuqmZm0pr7TqKVmmZyivLTAjJ2gnaakYrmmwIyhnKtllp65rnnBmqmboZVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
