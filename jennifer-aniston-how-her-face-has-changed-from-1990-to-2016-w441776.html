Her mother’s advice. “I’m really good with my skin. I think it’s the luck of having a mom [actress <b>Nancy Dow</b>] who was a model and was always obsessed with her skin,” the Living Proof cofounder <a href=#>told Yahoo Beauty</a>. “She always taught me to moisturize and wash my face every night, drink lots of water. It’s probably been the same routine since I was a kid. I use a Neutrogena face-cleaning bar, then I use the Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer. Every once in a while, I bring in some toners or serums from my facialist.”</p><p><span><i>Friends</i> wrapped in 2004 after 10 seasons and Aniston, who divorced Pitt in 2005 and </span><a href=#><span>married </span><b>Justin Theroux</b><span> in the summer of 2015</span></a><span>, went on to star in plenty of rom-coms. </span><i>The Break-Up</i><span>&nbsp;in 2006, </span><i>He’s Just Not That Into You</i><span>&nbsp;in 2009 and </span><i>Just Go with It</i><span> in 2011 cemented her as a romantic lead in big-screen feature films.</span></p><p><i>Horrible Bosses</i> in 2011 and <i>We’re the Millers</i> in 2013 continued Aniston’s comedy spree, but she’s also taken on roles in serious tearjerkers like 2008’s<i> Marley & Me</i> and dramas including 2014’s <i>Cake</i>, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2Byr7rIn5yrZZGjtrTAzqdkoaenYrWmvoyfmJydXZ2utHnCoZinn5WZeqe%2BzqZkanFpZXq1u4xrZ2puXayBdX2WcG1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
