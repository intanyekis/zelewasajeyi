Before she became a well-known actress, she married her high school sweetheart, Joe Gonzalez, in 1990.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>They had a son named Manolo in 1991, but after two years, they decided to go separate ways. After splitting from Gonzalez, Vergara dated but didn’t think about getting married again right away because she was focused on raising her son.</span></p><p><span>Sofía Vergara and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Joe Manganiello</a>, who were married for seven years, announced their breakup on July 17, 2023. Manganiello officially filed for divorce two days later, and by February 2024, it was all settled.</span></p><p><span>Vergara and Manganiello first met in 2014, introduced by actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson at a dinner.

A few weeks later, Vergara broke up with Loeb, and then Manganiello asked Ferguson for Vergara’s number.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even though Vergara didn’t think she was ready to date, Manganiello won her over, and the rest is history. Manganiello shared with People in 2020:</span></p><p><span>“I knew pretty quickly that I could trust her, and she knew pretty quickly that she could trust me. And we’re both the kind of people who are capable of putting the other person ahead of ourselves. I was capable of putting her wishes ahead of mine, whatever they were, and she was capable of doing the same. Once you have that, you don’t let go of it.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2LAsLLImmSvnaKcrrOtjKmpnp%2Belru1e5NucGpvXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
