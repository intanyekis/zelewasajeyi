Whether she's on the road, at a party, or eating with her family (which includes hubby <strong>Jason Hoppy</strong>, 40, and their daughter <strong>Bryn</strong>, 22 months) read on to learn what the busy star eats to stay in tip-top shape!</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>PHOTOS: Healthy eating advice from Jennifer Aniston, Katy Perry, and more fit celebs</a><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Have Fun; Vary It Up!</strong></p><p>The 41-year-old says she never eats the same thing twice in a row, which keeps her motivated to eat healthy. "Today I had a scooped out toasted whole wheat bagel. Yesterday I had oatmeal and half of a muffin — because I was on the road — and today for lunch I had a shrimp salad," she says. "Yesterday I had gnocchi with my husband at lunch. It’s different every single day. That’s the key to being naturally thin — not being so regimented."</p><p><strong>It's OK to Indulge</strong></p><p>One of the Bethenny Ever After star's favorite philosophies? "Your diet is your bank account." What that means: go ahead and indulge, but don't go overboard. "So if you are in the mood for chocolate cake one day, if you really, really want it, you should have it," she says. "If you have something in the morning that is not ideal then have something at lunch that is more ideal. It’s a better investment, and you balance it throughout the day so you end up having everything you want — just not all at once."</p><p><strong>Have a Happy Hour, Mindfully</strong></p><p>The creator of Skinnygirl Cocktails knows a thing or two about the calories lurking in your drink. When she's not imbibing her own mixes, she turns to another favorite — vodka sodas, which are about <a href=# rel=noopener>100 calories</a>. "You can take a flavor vodka, like a fruity flavor vodka, with club soda and then a little splash of your favorite juice and then pick either a lemon, a lime, or an orange to make it a whole fun thing," the star, whose Skinnygirl wine collection and vodkas with natural flavors hit stores this spring, says.</p><p>Head over to FitSugar <a href=# rel=noopener>for even more of Bethenny Frankel's healthy tips</a>.</p><p><span><strong>More from FitSugar:</strong></span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bethenny Frankel and More Celeb Moms Who've Rocked a Bikini While Pregnant</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Surprising Foods That Celebrity Trainers Won't Eat</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jennie Garth, Kelly Osbourne, and More Celebrities Who Danced the Weight Off on DWTS</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>How Sarah Jessica Parker Stays Healthy and Fit</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnaSdsq%2B62Gadq5meoLKtedGerZ6ZnKh6qbHRZqqkoZ6jxm6zyKujZqyinrCsedOoZKyska62r7OMp5itraKWua3FjK2foqZdZ31yfpRtZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
