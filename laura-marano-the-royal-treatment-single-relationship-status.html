From mystery dramas like Harlan Coben's Stay Close, to documentaries like The Tinder Swindler, audiences have been spoilt for choice of good content. Even an old show like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manifest has found new life in this new-year wave</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another production that has really resonated with fans is The Royal Treatment, a romantic drama film by Rick Jacobson. Starring in the picture is multi-talented actress Laura Marano, who plays a Manhattan-based hairdresser who gets the opportunity to work at a royal wedding.</p><p>The Royal Treatment is a major milestone in the career of Marano, who has had an impressive - if slightly understated - career. The actress is the younger sister of Ghost Whisperer star Vanessa Marano, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of a number of celebs who broke out on the CBS supernatural drama</a>. Laura also once made a cameo on the show.</p><p>In The Royal Treatment, she is flanked by Aladdin star Mena Massoud, who plays a prince from the fictional country of Lavania. Their chemistry in the movie has prompted some whispers of a fling between the two. But just exactly what is the truth about Marano's current dating status?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-laura-marano-have-a-fling-with-mena-massoud>Does Laura Marano Have A Fling With Mena Massoud?</h2><p>Fans were strongly impressed by the performances of Marano and Massoud opposite each other in the film. 'The Royal Treatment is a delightful surprise, armed with a sweet story and some charming performances from its two young leads,' one fan review <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reads on Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p><p>This smooth chemistry has prompted a lot of rumors that the two could probably be an item. The truth is completely different, though. Marano and Massoud first met on set while filming the rom-com back in February 2021. They struck up a good work partnership, but that's the extent of their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, Massoud has been in a long-term relationship with Emily Shah, an Indian-American actress who held the crown of Miss New Jersey in 2014. The two travel together frequently, and Shah often posts cute pictures of them together on her Instagram page.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Why Milo Ventimiglia Is Single</a></span></p><p>Marano sometimes shares photos of her and Massoud goofing around behind the scenes and off set. The images may have worked to fuel the rumors and speculation of their romantic involvement, but all they showcase is the two stars having a good time at work.</p><h2 id=who-is-laura-marano-dating-now>Who Is Laura Marano Dating Now?</h2><p>It appears that Marano tries as much as possible to keep her personal life away from public scrutiny. This is not surprising, given that it's a common thing for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities to keep details of their love lives under wraps</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Going by the information about Marano available in the public domain, all signs point towards the actress being currently single. Her most recent, publicly-known relationship was with R'n'B musician Thomas Macken. The two reportedly started dating in 2018, and stayed together for a period during the global COVID lockdown.</p><p>Marano - who herself is also a recording artist - would often go to Instagram to share some of their daily routines. However, that relationship appeared to peter out at some point in 2020, although reasons for any breakup remain unclear.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think This Is The Reason Henry Cavill Is Keeping His New Relationship Private</a></span></p><p>Macken's portfolio of work is not too shabby. He has worked on a few film soundtracks, including for the musical, Pitch Perfect.</p><p>Even after their breakup, Marano and Macken continued to collaborate, as she featured him in the remix of her song Run and also invited him to work with her on her EP, You.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-did-laura-marano-date-in-the-past>Who Did Laura Marano Date In The Past?</h2><p>Before her time with Macken, Marano had been in two known relationships. She was said to have briefly dated a guy called Andrew Gorin. The pair started dating in 2014, but separated a short time after. There is very little information known about who Gorin is, including the reasons for their breakup.</p><p>Between 2010 and 2011, Marano was involved with another musician - pop star Ross Lynch. The Colorado-born artist shares similar interests as Marano, seeing as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is also an actor</a>. The two of them connected while they were playing Austin Moon and Ally Dawson respectively, in the Disney comedy series Austin & Ally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show effectively gave Lynch his breakout role as an actor, resulting in four Teen Choice Awards between 2014 and 2016. In music, he was the lead vocalist of the pop-rock band R5. Currently, he headlines another band - the Driver Era (TDE) - alongside his brother, Rocky Lynch.</p><p>As was the case with Gorin and Macken, the reasons for Marano's breakup with Lynch remain unclear. It is also not known whether the pair have stayed in contact through the years, or not.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Michael Cera's Dating History</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijmq2ilnqurdGapahlpJ2ybr7OspilZaSnsqLAzJ6lrWWjnruouMRmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZaOprrXB0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
