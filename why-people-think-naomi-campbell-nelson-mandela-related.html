Mandela would obtain his BA through the University of South Africa and would go back to Fort Hare for his graduation in 1943. In 1964 Nelson would be sent to <strong>Robben Prison, </strong>where he would spend 18 years of his life and then an additional 8 years in other prisons <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">until his <strong>release in 1990</strong></a>. Nelson would witness the end of <strong>Apartheid </strong>before becoming the <strong>President of South Africa </strong>in '94. Though Nelson has passed, he no doubt changed the lives of people he interacted with (<a href=#>including Will Smith, who was reduced to tears when they first met</a>.)</p><h2 id=who-is-naomi-campbell><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Who Is Naomi Campbell?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Naomi Elaine Campbell </strong>was born May 22, 1970, in <strong>South London. </strong>Campbell<strong> </strong>attended the Barbara Speake Stage School before being accepted into the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. After being scouted by the <strong>Synchro Model Agency,</strong> Naomi would attain international success and fame after appearing on the cover of <strong>British Elle. </strong>Campbell would then attain the status of Supermodel, along with fellow models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, and Kate Moss. The group would be known as the "<strong>Big Six.”</strong> Campbell’s status was firmly planted from there, going on to receive fan and critic admiration, as well as being highly influential (so much so, that <a href=#>Kim Kardashian has been accused of ‘wanting to be her’ by some fans</a>.)</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Amy Schumer And Naomi Campbell Applaud Halsey For Showing Off Her Real Post-Birth Body</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-naomi-campbell-and-nelson-mandela-meet><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Did Naomi Campbell And Nelson Mandela Meet?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Campbell </strong>met <strong>Mandela</strong> in '94 as Naomi was on her way to South Africa. In an interview with Instyle.com, Naomi spoke about her first meeting with the late Mandela, “I went to South Africa to judge Miss World 1994. They paid me to be there, but I wanted to donate my time to Mandela’s political party, the African National Congress. When I got off the stage, they said to me that I was going to see President Nelson Mandela tomorrow, and that’s how it all started.”</p><h2 id=campbell-once-flew-78-people-out-to-south-africa-to-meet-mandela><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Campbell Once Flew 78 People Out To South Africa To Meet Mandela</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What good is meeting one of the most interesting and inspiring people if you can’t share it with someone… or numerous people? Well, that’s precisely what Campbell had in mind when the supermodel flew more than <strong>70 of her friends out to meet Mandela.</strong> In an interview with AMAKA Studios, Campbell said, “Meeting Tata, the late president Nelson Mandela, for me, is an experience that I can only share with you. And I did share with a lot of my friends,” she said. “When I met him, I was like, ‘I want everyone to meet him.’ So, I took 78 people from New York City — hair, makeup, and all the models we know — to Cape Town to meet Tata.” Campbell continued, “I know they will never forget it. That’s how I am; I want to share as well as connect and communicate.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Close Were Naomi Campbell And Gianni Versace?</a></span></p><h2 id=mandela-saved-campbell-with-one-phone-call><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mandela Saved Campbell With One Phone Call</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Naomi</strong> has a violent side. There’s no getting around it (and it’s been well documented, <a href=#>being on full display during this interview</a>). One particular incident <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had the supermodel possibly facing 7 years jail time</a>, if not for a phone call to her from <strong>Mr. Mandela. </strong>Nelson would call Naomi and discuss her anger issues, having the supermodel face her anger, not hide from it. This would lead to Campbell realizing she was angry about her father not being present in her life, as well as her mother being mostly absent throughout her life.</p><h2 id=mandela-christened-campbell-his-lsquo-honorary-granddaughter-rsquo><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mandela Christened Campbell His ‘Honorary Granddaughter’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nelson had such an affinity for Naomi that he would christen her his <strong>“honorary granddaughter.” </strong>According to InStyle, Campbell said, “He was bigger than the sun, that’s how I describe him. <strong>Granddad </strong>was very charismatic and easygoing. I couldn’t believe I was there. I had no idea that I would later have a relationship like<strong> granddaughter-grandfather.</strong>” Later in the interview, Campbell would go on to say, “This man truly cared and brought me into his family. I became friends with his daughters, Zindzi and Zenani. Being close to them, I also always got to visit Mama Winnie [Mandela]... I have the utmost respect for Mama Graça [Machel], and I'm very close to her and her kids, too. He taught me to be my true, authentic self and to stick to my integrity," she added. "Not everyone's going to like me, and I'm not asking everyone to like me, but I'm going to be true to whatever I commit myself to supporting. He also taught me to share with other people. He became a significant person in my life and will always be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Naomi Campbell's Billionaire Ex-Boyfriend Sued Her For $3 Million, Here's Why</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdpbKwvMueZK2gmaO4brrAqKSiZZOWurGuxKWjZqaVocCwuoymmKeclaGubr7EpZitnZRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
