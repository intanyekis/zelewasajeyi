She began acting since she was a kid and has literally grown up in front of our eyes. Today, at the age of 20, Peyton has been featured on numerous magazine covers and has shown us a way more mature side to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Peyton has transitioned from Disney star to Hollywood A-lister, and her fashion style has also changed, as she has gotten older. The actress has been spotted at Oscar parties and a recent Vanity Fair party, celebrating a wave of new entertainers in head to toe designer, and she has really shown her fans that she knows a thing or two about fashion. Besides her very cool taste in clothes, we've also seen the starlet transform from girl next door to the girl everyone wants to be. And with over 12 million Instagram followers, Peyton is quickly becoming Hollywood's new "it" girl.</p><p>These 20 photos of Peyton Roi List show's how the young actress has gone from every young girl's favorite Disney Channel star to a fashionista everyone wants to take style notes on. Check out these photos of this emerging young star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=disney-s-new-it-girl>Disney's New It Girl</h2><p>You may have heard of Peyton Roi List on the Disney Channel comedy series,&nbsp;Jessie,&nbsp;or it's spinoff,&nbsp;Bunk'd, or watched her star as Holly on the very funny, The Diary of a Wimpy Kid,&nbsp;series. She quickly became one of Disney's new favorite stars with her charm and likeability and was named the new "Queen of Comedy" of the Disney Channel. Peyton has been in the acting business since she was 4, and now at the age of 20, Peyton is steadily becoming one of Hollywood's new "it girls." She's showed us that not only can she make her fans laugh, but she also has a great sense of style. While the star can certainly do comedy, she wants to dip her feet into more serious roles now that she's an adult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shying-away-from-comedies>Shying Away From Comedies</h2><p>Peyton Roi List first appeared on a television series called As The World Turns, where she played the role of a little girl. Since then, List has appeared in 16 television shows starting from 2004. While many people recognize the star from Disney's,&nbsp;Jessie, you may not have known that Peyton also has a few movies under her belt. Her first appearance on the big screen was for Spider-Man 2, where she portrayed a small kid playing on the stairs. She later starred alongside YouTube's, Logan Paul, in the film titled The Thinning, a film that showed that Peyton can take on more serious roles and it looks like it is certainly something Peyton wants to do more of in the future.</p><h2 id=the-next-selena-gomez>The Next Selena Gomez?</h2><p>Besides starring in a bunch of shows and movies, Peyton has also focused on her modeling career. In 2009, the blonde beauty appeared on the cover of American Girl and in 2011, modeled for Justice&nbsp;magazine. Since then, Peyton has appeared in over 400 print and television commercials. As she got older, she appeared on the front cover of Modeliste magazine, where they named her the “Girl on Fire,” Bella&nbsp;magazine, where she was named “The New Young Hollywood,” and showed off her a more grown-up side on the cover of&nbsp;Kode&nbsp;magazine, posing rather seductively. She’s also been on the covers of Nationalist, Girl's Life, and Mod magazine. Her career has skyrocketed since being on the Disney Channel, just like a few other big name celebrities have, including Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=showing-off-her-personal-style>Showing Off Her Personal Style</h2><p>As Peyton List got older, we got to see this young star show off her personal style. She went from wearing all pink and girly dresses to showing off a more mature side like in this photo, where the starlet attended the Just Fab Ready-To-Wear Launch Party in West Hollywood back in 2015. She ditched her flats for a pair of killer black heels and showed off her toned legs in a pair of black and white striped shorts and black shirt. Looking cool and casual, Peyton was starting to show her fans that she grew up a lot since starring at Emma Ross on Disney. There were a number of stars at the party, including Jamie Chung, Olivia Culpo, Aubrey Plaza, Katherine McPhee, and Maria Menounos. At only 17-years-old, Peyton was already hanging out with A-list stars and making a bigger name for herself in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cool-girl-at-coachella>Cool Girl At Coachella</h2><p>Every Hollywood star attends Coachella, and not only do these megastars go to dance and sing to their favorite musicians, they also love to show off their fashion game. Peyton List attended a pre-party hosted by PopSugar, wearing a handmade outfit from the Australian designer, Denisse m. Vera, and showed us that besides acting and modeling, she has a passion for fashion and likes to stay away from trends because she makes her own. "I am staying away from trends," Peyton said in an interview before making her way to Coachella, adding, "I am doing my own take on everything. I feel like a festival is the one place where I can do something that's so different and cool. I brought lots of different boots, lots of things I can move in, that will be fun to dance in, and let looks in, and vibe out in.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=making-herself-known-on-red-carpets>Making Herself Known On Red Carpets</h2><p>Peyton List attended the Nylon and BCBG Generation May Young Hollywood Party at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel back in 2014 in California and looked stunning in this red and pink ensemble. Peyton looked mature and stylish as she posed for cameras on the red carpet. This is one of Peyton's best looks. The starlet looks sophisticated, but her outfit is still appropriate for her age. In an interview with InStyle magazine, Peyton talked about fashion and trends she admires. When asked about her go-to shopping spots she stated, "Urban Outfitters, Nordstrom, and Bloomingdale's. I like mixing high-end finds with less expensive items. I've been known to pair an outfit from Forever 21 with Chanel shoes." And you'll never catch Peyton in anything that is low cut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=copying-her-style-icon-blake-lively>Copying Her Style Icon Blake Lively</h2><p>Peyton List admitted that her style icon is Blake Lively, and we could definitely see that she's been taking notes from her. Here, the star looks incredible and knows how to pick clothes that fit her well. She looks amazing without showing too much or too little and we love how she hasn't turned into a wild child like the former Disney star, Bella Thorne, who has gone from one of Disney’s most loveable stars to a wild child. Talking about her style icon, Peyton said, "She's very classic and elegant, and always looks just flawless. I've loved her since the Gossip Girl days. Her style on that show was so perfect, and it still meets up with today's fashion even when I go back and watch it now. It's just so good."</p><h2 id=peyton-s-all-grown-up>Peyton's All Grown Up</h2><p>Peyton List looks all grown up in this 2016 shoot for Modeliste magazine. The magazine focuses on style, fashion, travel, and art and has featured top named stars like Zendaya, Sophia Richie, Sarah Hyland, Kristen Cavallari, and Jordyn Woods. Peyton posed for the cover of the October issue and totally showed us a side of her that we've never seen before. She rocked multiple outfits like this white tube top and pants set that made her look ultra cool. However, when she's not posing for photo-shoots and magazine covers, Peyton mentioned that her go-to fashion must-haves are high-waisted jeans and a crop top. "High-waisted jeans from Hudson, Joe's, and L' Agence. I cannot wear low-waisted jeans - I'm constantly pulling them up. Really, I'm most comfortable in a high-wasited bottom with a crop top. If I'm feeling good and I've been working out a lot, then I'll wear it with no jacket - but if not, I'll drape something over my shoulders," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-ross-who>Emma Ross Who?</h2><p>Peyton looked amazing for the September 2017 issue of InStyle magazine. And while magazine's love to alter a celebrity, whether it's slimming them down or airbrushing their face, Peyton has said before that she's not a fan of filtering and doesn't even filter her photos on her personal social media accounts. She said in an interview, "If you want to edit your photos and make yourself look different, go for it. That is up to you, but in my opinion, you should always post things that you think do a good job at representing who you are. I choose to use no more than on filter on my photos, and I have never used FaceTune or any body-editing apps. I think you might as well embrace who you are and look like yourself!" It's great knowing that Peyton isn't like every other celeb who is addicted to Photoshopping their images!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=looking-like-a-celebrity-bombshell>Looking Like A Celebrity Bombshell</h2><p>Peyton List made heads turn when she attended the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2017. Wearing a tight leather pencil skirt, a white bustier and high heels, she looked nothing like the Disney Channel star we all knew. Peyton was definitely not looking boring at the award show and she makes that her mantra. She said, "I don't want to be boring, and I never want people to think it's a snoozefest. I want to find the middle point between looking classic and also trying something new." The actress stood out in this number and we got to see a more grown up Peyton. Also, it seems like&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jessie star&nbsp;loves to experiment with fashion and she makes us want to see more of her&nbsp;style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=giving-us-a-rock-and-roll-vibe>Giving Us A Rock And Roll Vibe</h2><p>Peyton can pull off any style and she looked very rock and roll in this number. Attending the debut of Thomas Wylde's 'Warrior II' collection at Pacific Design Center, in West Hollywood, California, Peyton showed her fans that she could be edgy, too. The starlet was among many other fashion influencers, including, Chantel Jeffries, Christina Milian, Pia Mia, and Aubrey O'Day. Peyton decided on wearing a dress that pretty much looked like a men's button down, and wrapped a chic belt around her waist and completed the look with over the knee black boots. If you're wondering how Peyton manages to keep looking good for the cameras, just follow her best beauty hack advice. She shared, "if my face gets shiny while I'm out, I pat my skin with a disposable toilet seat cover from the bathroom. It works like an oil-blotting sheet."</p><h2 id=most-adorable-couple-ever>Most Adorable Couple Ever?</h2><p>Peyton List and the&nbsp;Shameless star, Cameron Monaghan, is possibly the cutest celebrity couple in Hollywood. The two were spotted back September 2017 having a fun time at Disneyland, holding hands and sharing adorable Instagram photos of their experience. Cameron loves posting photos of Peyton on his Instagram account and the two have been going strong for quite some time. The two reportedly got close the spring of 2017 while filming their movie,&nbsp;Anthem, which is set to premiere this year. The movie tells the story of a teenager named Luke, played by Monaghan, who foresees the death of his best friend, Stan, and falls in love with his friend's girlfriend, Faith, who is played by List. The couple definitely doesn’t keep their relationship a secret and love going to events together, unlike most Hollywood celebs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=looking-effortless>Looking Effortless</h2><p>Peyton's looks are constantly changing and she looks amazing in this silk dress. She really is embodying her fashion hero, Blake Lively. By not overdoing it when it comes to her wardrobe, Peyton keeps it simple, yet, really elegant at this event. While we aren't sure who designed her dress, Peyton has mentioned that her dream designer is Carolina Herrera. "Her pieces are effortless and really feminine," Peyton told InStyle mag. She also told the fashion magazine that she's obsessed with '50s and '60s styles, saying, "Everyone was so polished. It's a step up from the comfy North Face and jeans look a lot of people default to now." Peyton clearly doesn’t need fashion advice because she looks impeccable, especially in this dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=turns-to-street-style-bloggers-for-fashion-inspo>Turns To Street-Style Bloggers For Fashion Inspo</h2><p>Peyton attended the Women In Film Max Mara Face of the Future Awards in Los Angeles last summer and looked flawless in this white dress. The actress paired a mirror gold clutch with this white lace dress for the 2017 event and even took her beau, Cameron Monaghan, with her. She topped her look with a slicked-back hairstyle, and again, the starlet looked effortless. Peyton always looks amazing when she steps out on a red carpet or to an event, so whom does she turn to for fashion inspiration? "I follow street-style bloggers like Marni Reisender of Style on the Rise and Julia Engel of Gal Meets Glam, and I rip out images from magazines for a mood board I keep on my bedroom wall," the star said.</p><h2 id=making-heads-turn-on-magazine-covers>Making Heads Turn On Magazine Covers</h2><p>The actress was dubbed "The New Young Hollywood" in the November/December 2017 issue of Bella magazine, where Peyton List was also featured on the cover. In the mag, the Disney star talked about her upcoming projects, bullying, living in Brooklyn, and shared what fans may not know about her. She shared, "I think people are surprised when you're nice. I've played characters who are mean girls, and sometimes people assume I might be rude or not a nice person. The truth is, I am super-normal and laid back. I want to become friends with anyone who comes up to me. And I might post these pictures that show me looking glamorous, but at the end of the day, I'm a mess!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vogue-takes-notice-of-peyton-s-awesome-style>Vogue Takes Notice Of Peyton's&nbsp;Awesome Style</h2><p>This is not the Peyton List we all knew from the Disney Channel. The actress made jaws drop when she posed for Kode&nbsp;magazine back in June 2017. Now that she's starting to transition into more serious roles, she's also showing her fans a more mature side to her and these photos tell us Peyton's definitely all grown up! Her fashion style has made headlines and even Vogue took notice of her, including Peyton on their list of "8 Teen Styles Stars Set To Rule 2017." She told Kode mag, "I idolize everything Vogue puts out so the fact that I am one of those people they have their eye on is mind blowing. It also validates being different and continuing to play around with my style and people will take notice." The star also mentioned that she hopes her fans from her time on Disney will follow her progression and see that she's becoming a well-rounded adult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=peyton-shares-her-guilty-pleasure>Peyton Shares Her Guilty Pleasure</h2><p>Peyton really showed off her mature side when she posted this photo of her in a pool, wearing a white bikini on her Instagram. The photo received over half a million likes, which is no surprise since the actress is stunning. We wonder what Cameron thinks of this photo? If you follow Peyton on Instagram, she shares a lot of photos of her with her friends, intimate photos with Cameron and pictures of herself from magazine and photo shoots. We also get to see a little of Peyton's personal life, like catching the sunset in California and going to parties with her gal pals. When the star isn't going to events or posing for pictures, she likes to relax and mentioned that her guilty pleasure is Nutella. "I love to eat Nutella straight out of the jar while binge watching something, or a hot bath after a long day,” she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heating-up-on-the-tennis-court>Heating Up On The Tennis Court</h2><p>Peyton may not have played tennis when she was a kid, but she can definitely pull off this look while posing on a tennis court. However, the star did admit that what fans don't know about her is that she's pretty athletic. The actress actually used to run track when she was younger. Peyton always looks toned and in shape and mentioned that her favorite thing to do is to go hiking. "I feel really lucky to live in Los Angeles," she said, adding, "It's great because I get to do a lot of outdoor activities all year round. Above all, I really love hiking. I live on a hillside and there's a hiking trail close to my house with a big swing and a tree at the top. Whenever my friends come over, I always tell them to bring their workout clothes so that we can hike up there. It's a 30-minute hike, which is great. If I want to get a really good workout, I go up and down twice!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=peyton-s-made-quite-the-transformation-since-being-on-disney>Peyton's Made Quite The Transformation Since Being On Disney</h2><p>The actress showed a more seductive side to her during this Krissy Saleh photo-shoot. With a heart-shaped box of chocolates and lounging on a pink couch, Peyton looked nothing like the Disney star we grew up watching. Just like her Kode magazine shoot, Peyton looks way more mature, but knows that her Disney fans will understand that she's just growing up just like any other girl. Talking about getting older side by side with her fans since her Disney days, she said, "It honestly feels like a natural progression. I'm growing older and so are the original Jessie fans." The star has made quite the transformation since playing Emma at the age of 12.</p><h2 id=what-s-to-come-for-this-star>What's To Come For This Star?</h2><p>Peyton Roi List has made a huge transformation since starring on Disney Channel's Jessie and Bunk'd. Now at the age of 20, Peyton has already become a style influencer and her fans from her days on Disney have continued to stick by her side and follow her success as an actress. We wouldn’t be surprised if the starlet gets to design her own clothes in the future. If Vogue praises your fashion taste, then you've pretty much made it, right? We are going to see a lot more of Peyton List in the future. She already has a new movie coming out with her beau Cameron, and her fashion style has continued to make heads turn. This is one celebrity transformation that we love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmV6qrnAoJysZZ%2BberGx2K2mp2WipLZuuMisq6xlpKeur7%2FFqKmmmaSevK95xaumpmWUnsCvsdhmq6hlmal6qLXRpWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
