She really appreciates the difficulty they go through to get tickets and be there at her concerts. It's amazing really. She'll be on stage trying to focus and entertain for almost four hours straight, but still able to spot an injustice in the huge crowd and speak (shout) her mind. It speaks volumes about the kind of person she is and why so many people adore her. Never mess with a swiftie in front of Taylor!"</p><p>"Taylor is someone who isn’t afraid to say if someone is being disrespectful and I think that is an amazing quality."</p><p>It all turned out to be a great moment and one those fans will never forget.
