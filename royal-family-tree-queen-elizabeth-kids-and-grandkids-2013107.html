One year later, they welcomed their first child,<a href=#><strong> King Charles III</strong></a>, who ascended to the throne following the queen’s death in September 2022. Elizabeth and Philip also shared daughter <a href=#><strong>Anne, Princess Royal</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Prince Andrew</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Prince Edward</strong></a>.</p><p>“He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family,” <a href=#>Her Majesty said of her husband</a> in November 1997 on the couple’s 50th wedding anniversary. “This and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.”</p><p>As the duo grew in love, so did their family. All four of their children have two kids of their own, with Anne’s son, <a href=#><strong>Peter Phillips</strong></a> (born in 1977) and daughter <a href=#><strong>Zara Tindall</strong></a> (1981) becoming the queen’s first grandchildren.</p><p>Charles then welcomed two sons, <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>, with ex-wife <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>. Andrew has two daughters, <a href=#><strong>Princess Beatrice</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Princess Eugenie</strong></a>, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Sarah Ferguson</strong></a>.</p><p>Edward and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh</strong></a>’s kids are <a href=#>significantly younger than their cousins</a>, with <strong>Lady Louise</strong> and <strong>James, Viscount Severn</strong> being born in 2003 and 2007, respectively.</p><p>The Queen has continued to <a href=#>cater toward her family</a> while balancing her duties as Sovereign of the United Kingdom. She was especially close with <a href=#>her grandsons William and Harry</a> and had a special bond with William’s wife, <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a>.</p><p>“She’s really taken Kate under her wing,” a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly exclusively</a> in April 2019. “The two of them will often spend hours discussing royal life and the future of the monarchy.”</p><p>A second source said that the <a href=#>Princess of Wales and Elizabeth</a>&nbsp;would sometimes “casually catch up over afternoon tea” while other meetings include “intense one-on-one training about taking on the crown.”</p><p>When Beatrice <a href=#>married <strong>Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi</strong> in July 2020</a>, she wore her grandmother’s vintage gown and diamond fringe tiara. The tiara was previously worn by both Her Majesty and Princess Anne on their wedding days.</p><p>Eugenie, on the other hand, <a href=#>named her firstborn son, August Philip Hawke</a>, whom she shares with husband <a href=#><strong>Jack Brooksbank</strong></a>, in honor of her grandfather in February 2021.</p><p>Although Harry and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>, stepped back from their roles as senior royals in January 2020, and have since relocated to California, Elizabeth and Philip <a href=#>tried to maintain their strong relationship with their grandson</a> and his firstborn, <a href=#>Archie</a>.</p><p>“The last thing Elizabeth wants is for Harry to feel estranged from his family,” a source told Us in March 2020. A second source added that Harry “<a href=#>feels terrible about hurting his grandmother</a>, whom he adores” because of his family’s decisions.</p><p>In June 2021, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex <a href=#>announced the arrival of their second child</a>, daughter Lilibet, <a href=#>whose name is a nod to the queen</a>.</p><p>In September 2022, <a href=#>Buckingham Palace confirmed that the queen died at the age of 96</a>, shortly after <a href=#>receiving medical attention at Balmoral castle</a> in Scotland. “The queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon,” the palace said in a statement at the time. “The king and the queen consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.”</p><p>Charles mourned the loss of his mother in a statement released shortly after her death. “<a href=#>The death of my beloved mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness</a> for me and all members of my family,” the statement read. “We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>He was officially crowned king</a> during a service at Westminster Abbey in <a href=#>London months later in May 2023,</a>&nbsp;in a historic event overseen by the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p><p>Scroll down for a look at four generations of Queen Elizabeth II’s royal family tree.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv7DFwKVkn5mdnrm6edOrnJ5loaqyprqMnqOispGXsrW0jKSgnatdlrulecarmKecm56xtHmRaWhsaWBsfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
