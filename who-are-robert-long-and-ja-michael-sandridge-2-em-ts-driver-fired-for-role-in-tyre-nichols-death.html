The trio comprised EMT workers, Robert Long and JaMichael Sandridge, along with Lt Michelle Whitaker, who got terminated for violating department policy.</p><p>In a statement, Fire Chief Gina Sweat said EMTs Robert Long and JaMichael Sandridge “failed to conduct an adequate patient assessment” upon seeing the injured Nichols after police had stopped beating him and the actions of three or "inactions on the scene that night do not meet the expectations of the <a href=# rel>Memphis Fire Department</a> and are not reflective of the outstanding service the men and women of the Memphis Fire Department provide daily in our community," as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail.</a></p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Tyre Nichols: Internet accuses paramedics of ‘doing nothing’ as Memphis man lay dying</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Disgustingly vile': Internet blasts user for saying Tyre Nichols should have 'relaxed' and OBEYED cops</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8e49b5be-d8e2-4f85-8dd2-977b06d0c06c.png><p>According to a statement posted on Facebook, MFD received a call from the Memphis Police Department (MPD) to respond to an individual being pepper sprayed at the intersection of East Raines Road and Ross Road on January 7 at 8.31 pm. Following MFD protocol, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">First Responder</a> company Engine 55 was dispatched a minute later, and arrived on the scene at 8.36 pm. After an initial interaction with a police officer at that scene, Engine 55 was directed to the second location on Ross Road and Castlegate Lane. The two EMTs made the scene where Nichols was located handcuffed on the ground and leaning against a police vehicle approximately at 8.41 pm. But the driver of Engine 55, Lt Whitaker, remained inside the fire engine.</p><p>After an interaction with Nichols, they requested an ambulance to respond. Emergency Unit 28 was dispatched at 8.46 pm and arrived on the scene at 8.55 pm. They transported Nichols to Saint Francis Hospital at 9.08 pm.</p><h2 class=split>The tragic death of Tyre Nichols</h2><p>A "confrontation" occurred between the officers and Nichols on January 7, who then fled on foot, Memphis police said according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>. The officers apprehended him and "another confrontation" ensued, resulting in Nichols' arrest. Pepper spray was used during the initial confrontation, and Nichols ran away, Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy said. However, officers "found him again at another location, and at that point there was an amount of aggression that is unexplainable. There was another altercation at a nearby location, at which serious injuries were experienced by Mr Nichols. After some period of time of waiting around afterward, he was taken away by an ambulance," Mulroy said. Three days after the incident and Nichols' death resulted in second-degree murder charges against five officers, Desmond Mills Jr, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, and Justin Smith, as <a href=# rel>previously reported.</a></p><p>With the release of a video by MPD on January 27 showing the brutal beating of the 29-year-old, the world was stunned and angry with the actions of the police. One said, "Those cops deserve everything that’s coming to them." Another tweeted, "IT WAS TORTURE THEN MURDER...MAX TIME IN JAIL."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Those cops deserve everything that’s coming to them.</p>— GrayMan (@GRAYMAN1357) <a href=#>January 28, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>IT WAS TORTURE THEN MURDER...MAX TIME IN JAIL</p>— richard flood (@richard51377349) <a href=#>January 28, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'They were all negligent in their duties'</h2><p>Now following the termination, many again expressed their views with individual writing, "The right decision was made. There is no debate. They had a duty to act. A duty to act does not mean you take information from a police officer. There is no defense for anyone of the persons on scene that night actions or inactions. Watch the videos and you can see clearly from the videos this man was not just peppered sprayed. The police officers, the sheriffs officers, the engine crew they were all negligent in their duties." One more said, "I hope a termination under these circumstances strips them of their government funded benefits including pension!!!! They should not draw a dime! I also hope they are indicted for the same charges."</p><p>While a Facebook user pointed out saying, "I still don't see how it's their fault tho when all they was told is that it was pepper spray." To which, one replied by commenting, "For all those who say “But what did they do wrong? They were called for a subject who was pepper sprayed and if you take the time to watch the pole camera basically performed a poor patient assessment. Nichols clearly kept falling over hitting the ground because he couldn’t even sit up right. Remember guys and gals FF’s/EMT’s always give the most upright respect and care while treating a patient regardless of race, religion, gender or creed. Just ask yourself and please put politics/affiliations aside. If Nichols was your family member would you be ok with how he was treated for his injuries on scene if you watched the footage released?"</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
