Its 16 matte and shimmery colors — which feature a series of peaches, plums and, of course, browns — boast to-die-for pigments and ultimate wearability for all skin tones. But one of the best features of the Chocolate Bar is its yummy smell, as each shade (with names such as Milk Chocolate, Cherry Cordial, Champagne Truffle and Gilded Ganache) is infused with cocoa powder.</p><p>Though <b>Lauren Rincon</b>, a tweeter from South El Monte, California, was aware that the palette wasn’t edible, her adorable young niece didn’t know.</p><p>“MY NIECE ATE MY TOO FACED CHOCOLATE BAR PALLETTE BC IT SMELLS LIKE CHOCOLATE I DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD CRY OR LAUGH,” Rincon tweeted on Saturday, July 30, along with two photos of the chubby-cheeked culprit covered in makeup, along with the destroyed product. Rincon’s niece seemingly dipped a wet finger in each color, taste-testing liberal amounts of the Hazelnut, Marzipan and Creme Brulee shades.</p><p>https://twitter.com/llaurenbbby/status/759477937942827009</p><p>Rincon’s tweet racked up more than 47,000 retweets, 54,000 likes and loads of concern from fellow tweeters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/two-faced-eyeshadow-zoom-ba7ee368-24fd-40fd-ae4e-6a8deb68fcb8.png><p>One person expressed their deepest sympathies, responding to the tweet with a GIF of Mean Girls character&nbsp;Regina George crying. “sorry to hear about the loss of your loved one,” <a href=#>@letsgeeetweeird captioned</a>.</p><p>But others were more distressed than amused. “ARE YOU NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOUR COUSIN,” another tweeter asked.</p><p>Rincon addressed concerns once she received flack for her tweet. “too faced let me know that there isnt any harmful ingredients but well definitely take her to the doctors if she shows any signs of sickness,” she wrote on July 30. “Also contacted poison control for further assurance and they said shes fine even if she ate a large amount she would only maybe get diarrhea.”</p><p>But luckily, Rincon’s niece — and her palette — are both fine. “update: after a million q-tips & napkins later I was able to save my baby, except for a few colors :/,” she tweeted the same day, along with the patched-up palette.</p><p>And now she has a reason to turn her frown upside down. &nbsp;</p><p>“Somebody who works at too faced messaged me saying she’s going to send me another chocolate bar pallete I’m crying ,” she wrote on July 31.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5Z6pLTIpZtmmaSaerW7zmadmpuVmcBur8eomqikkamybq7Aq2SpmZyawbWxjKmgnKtdrIF0fpJvcGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
