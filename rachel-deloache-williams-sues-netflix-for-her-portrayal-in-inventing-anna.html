But even though it may have been one of their most popular shows of 2022, it’s recently gotten the streaming giant in legal trouble, as Rachel DeLoache Williams is suing for her portrayal in the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Released last February, the drama tells the true story of a journalist who investigated the case of Anna Delvey (also known as Anna Sorokin), a social media-famous, alleged heiress, who conned millions of dollars out of rich New York elites.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Serena Williams Wears Diamond-Encrusted Outfit For Last U.S. Open</a></span></p><p>Anna – who’s currently serving time in jail for her antics – was Russian born but moved to Germany in 2007. She later came to the United States in 2013 to work a magazine internship.</p><p>The Instagram star convinced those around her she was the heir to a mysterious overseas fortune, but her lies began to unravel in 2018 when she was unable to pay her bills or follow through with her projects.</p><p>Rachel&nbsp; was one of Anna’s friends in real life as well as the series. She was portrayed by actress Katie Lowes in the Netflix production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This week, the real Rachel filed a lawsuit for defamation and invasion of privacy. She’s accusing Netflix of exaggerating her portrayal in the show for “dramatic purposes.”</p><p>Specifically, Rachel is accusing Netflix of intentionally portraying her as “<a href=#>as a greedy, snobbish, disloyal, dishonest, cowardly</a>, manipulative and opportunistic person.” She’s also taking issue with how the show makes it appear that she was quick to accept lavish gifts from the faux socialite.</p><p>“In reality, [Rachel] never did or said those things,” he court filing states. “Thus, this action is based firmly on statements of fact which are demonstrably false and the attribution of statements that she never made.”</p><p>Rachel, a former Vanity Fair editor, is also challenging the show’s allegation that she only stopped being friends with Anna when she had financial troubles following their trip to Morocco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>Williams did not stop being friends</a> with Sorokin because Sorokin was having problems in Morocco,” the lawsuit continues. “But rather because she subsequently discovered on her return to New York that Sorokin was a liar and a con artist whose statements and promises had induced Williams to incur liabilities of around $62,000 on Sorokin’s behalf were false, and who only reimbursed her $5,000 despite numerous promises to reimburse her $70,000 to account for the full debt and any late fees incurred.”</p><p>It's unclear how much Rachel is hoping to make in damages from the defamation case.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Alec Baldwin Facing $25 Million Defamation Lawsuit Filed By Late Marine's Family</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Washington Post</a>, <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Foq%2FHnqNmnJWhvKKvx55ksKGcobaiudJmqq6do2K7psDFpaCxZZakv260xKtkqaeiqb%2BixcClZKKmXZ67t7HNraCnn12Wu6%2Btjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
