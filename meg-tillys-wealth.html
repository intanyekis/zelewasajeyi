She made her debut in the musical drama “Fame” in 1980 but had to halt her dance career due to a back injury.</p><p>Following this, she shifted her focus to acting and made her debut in the drama “The Trouble with Grandpa” in 1981. She then appeared in the second season of “Hill Street Blues” before landing her first starring role in “Tex,” alongside Matt Dillon. In 1983, she continued to gain prominence with the films “Psycho II” and “The Big Chill,” both of which received numerous Academy Award nominations and significantly boosted her net worth.</p><p>In 1985, Tilly’s role in “Agnes of God” earned her a Golden Globe Award. Throughout the late 1980s, she appeared in “Valmont” and “The Two Jakes.” In 1993, she starred in the horror film “Body Snatchers,” but paused her acting career for the next 15 years after sustaining a soccer-related injury. She made a comeback in 2010 with an episode of “Caprica” and contributed to the six-part series “Bomb Girls,” which garnered her several awards.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, Tilly began publishing novels, starting with “Singing Songs” in 1994.
