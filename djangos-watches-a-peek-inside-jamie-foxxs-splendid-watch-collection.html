In reality, his performance in the 2004 biographical film Ray earned him an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA. Foxx's <a href=#>mind blowing breakthrough on TV</a> opened new doors for him in music, television, and cinema. He also produced and composed his debut album, Peep This, which was released in 1994. Two years later, he was chosen to star in The Jamie Foxx Show, a five-season television sitcom. Although Foxx played a teenage quarterback who is seemingly cocky yet frightened of failure in Any Given Sunday (1999), his performance in the sex comedy Booty Call (1997) established him as a significant factor. Foxx's portrayal demonstrated that his acting skills went well beyond mere comic impersonations, as did his part as cornerman Drew&nbsp;0000000 Brown in the biopic Ali (2001).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The estimated net worth of Jamie Foxx is $170 million.
