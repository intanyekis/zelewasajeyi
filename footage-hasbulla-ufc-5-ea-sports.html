He is also pals with MMA legend Khabib Nurmagomedov and several other Russian fighters.</p><p>EA Sports confirmed the video was legit by reposting it to their X - formerly known as Twitter - page.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON HASBULLA">READ MORE ON HASBULLA</h2><p>In September 2022, Hasbulla signed a five-year <a href=#>contract with the UFC</a>.</p><p>It remains unclear what his role with MMA’s premier promotion is, but UFC CEO Dana White has refused to rule out <a href=#>lining up a fight</a> for the talented youngster.</p><p>Hasbulla first found fame when he featured in a mock fight press conference.</p><p>He squared off with Abdu Rozik, who also has a form of dwarfism, and together they racked up millions of views on social media.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in MMA</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-24-152330.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-24-152256.png><p>Their rivalry reached boiling point in October 2021 when they came to blows at&nbsp;<a href=#>UFC 267</a>&nbsp;in Abu Dhabi – but talk of them fighting ended when the Russian Dwarf Athletic Association branded the match-up 'unethical'.</p><p>Last week, Rozik visited the talkSPRORT studio to show off his boxing skills on a <a href=#>cardboard cutout of Hasbulla</a> and reignite their feud.</p><p>“Always ready to fight Hasbulla,” he said.</p><p>“I’m ready, always! I don’t like him.</p><p>“He’s like when people are not respectful. If he sees somebody, he punches him immediately. It’s not even, ‘Hi, how are you?’ If he sees you… he is coming and punching you.”</p><p>Hasbulla has yet to respond to his rival, and it appears the only way fans will get to see him fight is if EA SPORTS decide to make him a playable character on UFC 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraGlmZoFxfJFonainpJa0pnnHmqqbrZyhrm7BxZxkbmWVlnq0vM6rq6xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
