Andrew Valley passed away unexpectedly on Wednesday, September 27, 2023, leaving an indelible mark on the lives of those who had the privilege of knowing him.</p><p>Born in Providence, he was the son of Scott W. Valley and Robin A. (Brown) Valley. Besides his parents he leaves behind his older brother David Valley, his sister Jennifer Valley, his Aunt Paula Ferguson, his beloved cousins, and countless family members. He also leaves behind his beloved girlfriend, Kenzie Mingo. He was the grandson of the late Hugh and Elvia Brown.</p><p>More importantly Andrew was a devoted uncle to his nephew Jaxson Valley who he truly loved and adored. Becoming an uncle was something Andrew took seriously, and cherished. His bond with his nephew was unmatched as the love they showed one another always shined bright when they were together.</p><p>Andrew worked for Stanley Steamers driving trucks and going on service calls. He also worked at Bi-County Collaborative where he worked his days as a paraprofessional. He would devote his time working with children in so many different populations. He had a passion for softball, playing for Skeffs Pub and 401 Rivals. Andrew loved all sports, but Andrew was loved by his family and friends and had an infectious smile with a personality that was larger than life.</p><p>A <a href=# rel=noopener>GoFundMe page</a> was initiated by David Valley to assist with funeral expenses and additional financial needs. Andrew’s passion for softball was well-known, and he shared that love and dedication with those he played with or watched. The fund aims to provide support to the Valley family during this challenging time, alleviating any financial burden as they navigate through the grieving process.</p><p>Andrew T. Valley, aged 29, was a cherished member of the Providence community, known for his kindness and dedication. Calling hours have been scheduled for <strong>October 5, 2023, from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM</strong> at the PERRY-MCSTAY FUNERAL HOME, situated at 2555 Pawtucket Avenue, East Providence.</p><p>Andrew made meaningful contributions in his role at Stanley Steamers, Bi-County Collaborative, and his absence will be deeply felt by colleagues and friends alike. The community unites in offering their support and condolences to the Valley family during this time of sorrow. Andrew’s memory will forever live on in the hearts of those he touched.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51krq%2Bw0Z6uZq6RobmmxYyonWadkajBbrzRqK2inJWjsKZ50aJkqZmjqLK0ecCwmLJlkal6tbTEZpignV2ks25%2BmGamm6Gkqq6zxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
