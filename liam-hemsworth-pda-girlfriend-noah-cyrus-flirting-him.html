The Hemsworth siblings were there to show their support for their brother, Chris Hemsworth, 40, who takes on the role of the villainous Immorten Joe in the action-packed film, starring opposite Anya-Taylor Joy as Furiosa. Furiosa is set to hit theaters on May 24.</p><p>Liam and Brooks, who have been a couple since 2019, usually keep their relationship private on social media, rarely sharing photos of each other let alone appearing publicly, making their outing all the more significant.</p><p>The pair was first seen publicly together in December 2019, during a lunch outing with Liam’s parents in Byron Bay, Australia. At the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source exclusively told Us Weekly,</a> “His family approves of her and really likes her, which is very important to him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The insider added that Hemsworth “feels comfortable” with the model, indicating a positive reception from his family towards Brooks.</p><h2 id=how-liam-was-recently-dragged-into-the-cyrus-family-drama>How Liam Was Recently Dragged Into The Cyrus Family Drama</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Liam was previously married to singer and actress Miley Cyrus. The couple, who had an on-and-off relationship since meeting on the set of The Last Song in 2009, and later tied the knot in December 2018. However, their marriage was short-lived, as they announced their separation in August 2019, finalizing their divorce in January 2020.</p><p>Reports suggest that their differing lifestyles and Hemsworth's desire for a more settled life clashed with Cyrus's more unconventional and dynamic approach, leading to the split, though they’ve been selective about what they share publicly following their divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Cyrus family has been going through an alleged feud this year, after Miley’s mom Tish Cyrus married Prison Break star Dominic Purcell, even though he’d reportedly been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">romantically involved with her youngest daughter</a>, Noah Cyrus, 24, before beginning a relationship with her mom.</p><p>Not only did Noah boycott their wedding, along with their brother Braison Cyrus (though it was held at Miley’s home), the singer has seemingly been throwing shade at her family, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even liking a steamy gym selfie of Liam</a>. This caused fans to speculate if Noah was trying to send a message to her sister Miley and give the family a taste of their own medicine.</p><p>But with Liam refusing to engage publicly in the drama, he appears to be trying to stay a safe distance away from the Cyruses, despite his long history with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijopmdYrWmudKwpqusmGK9pa2MoKCrpJantqa6w2alqJmYYrC6vtSsZJ%2BkmafBqrrGZp%2BipV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
