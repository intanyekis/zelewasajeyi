The actress has been our hair idol in three separate decades, spanning back to her leading role on Friends. Her mane has made such an impact, chances are you know someone who copied the signature Rachel bob cut after watching the sitcom.</p><p>Aniston launched her own hair product line, Lolavie, a couple of years ago, but what was she using to keep her hair thick, healthy and glossy before her hair care existed?</p><p>Her close friend and hairstylist for decades, <strong>Chris McMillan</strong>, recently revealed to <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a> that she’s been a longtime fan of Kérastase. He regularly runs the <span class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kérastasé Discipline Oleo-Relax Advanced Hair Oil</a> through her hair to tame flyaways and boost shine. While this oil usually gets all of the hype, there’s another product from the brand that shoppers say deserves just as much praise — especially when it comes to restoring hair loss: the </span><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kérastase Densifique Densité Shampoo</a>.</span></p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kérastase Densifique Densité Shampoo</a> on Amazon!</strong></p><p>Aside from helping hair grow back stronger and thicker, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Densifique Densité Shampoo</a> provides a gentle, deep clean. Many shampoos can be too harsh on the follicle as they scrub away dirt and debris, which can ultimately lead to breakage. This unique formula prevents that from happening thanks to a mix of hyaluronic acid, peptides and ceramides. These ingredients are often found in gentle skincare products, and when used on hair, they can help to deeply moisturize, enhance shine and strengthen every last strand. And despite all of the rich components, the shampoo still feels lightweight and also manages to increase volume.</p><p>Shoppers of all genders with varying causes of hair thinning have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">experienced remarkable improvement</a> since incorporating this shampoo into their routine. “As happens with most men around their 50s, I’ve started to suffer with a thinning of my hair. What used to be lustrous curls, started to look patchy,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one reviewer explained</a>. “I have to say the results are amazing. My hair now looks like it did 10 years ago before it started thinning.”</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kérastase Densifique Densité Shampoo</a> on Amazon!</strong></p><p>New moms also swear by the shampoo to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">help with postpartum hair loss</a>. “I have always used this after having my babies, and it definitely helped me regain some density and strength,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another purchaser said</a>. “I do not use it every day, more like every other day, but I do notice results. The smell is seriously wonderful, and my hair looks very full and healthy after I use it.” She adds that patience is a virtue because it may take a few weeks of consistent use to notice a significant change — but she insists that “your hair will feel GOOD even before then.”</p><p>What are you waiting for?
