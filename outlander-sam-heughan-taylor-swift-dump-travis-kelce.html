He said he planned on wearing his Outlander wig to attract the singer, who wouldn't be able to resist his character's charm. With one look, Sam Heughan claims, he can make Taylor forget all about Travis Kelce.</p><h2 id=sam-heughan-made-a-pass-at-taylor-swift>Sam Heughan Made A Pass At Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sam-heughan.jpg><p>Sam Heughan is ready to shoot his shot at the Eras tour concert.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We’re gonna go see Taylor Swift play in Scotland," the actor said in a video he posted on Instagram. By "we" he means he and his Outlander co-stars. "I think most of the cast is going."</p><p>He was in costume as his famous character Jamie Fraser, and apparently, he believes his costume will be irresistible for the singer.</p><p>"She obviously doesn’t know this, but when she comes to Scotland and she sees me in the audience, she’s gonna forget all about … [Kelce] and fall for a man in a ginger wig," he boasted. "<strong>How could she resist? She’s gonna shake him off and take me out instead</strong>. I’m really excited."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sam Heughan captioned the video with "Welcome to Scotland Taylor!" and added, "JAMMF [James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser] is a Swiftie."</p><p>Fans went crazy about this bold move and laughed about it in the comments, jokingly rooting for him. "Scottish Chief coming straight home to me!" one user wrote, referencing Taylor Swift's song "Karma" and how she's been changing the lyrics of the song during her concerts as a nod to Travis Kelce.</p><h2 id=the-beginning-of-travis-and-taylor-39-s-love-story>The Beginning Of Travis And Taylor's Love Story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-1-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's love story is really one for the ages, and the way the Kansas City Chiefs tight end asked the pop star out is not so different from the way Sam Heughan was jokingly planning to. He wanted to slip the singer his number on a friendship bracelet, but when he didn't manage to see her, he shared his plans on his podcast, New Heights. His plan reached Taylor Swift's ears, and she found it adorable so she reached out to him anyway.</p><p>"<strong>This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell</strong>," she gushed in her interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TIME magazine</a> when she was named Person of the Year in 2023. "We started hanging out right after that. <a href=# rel=nofollow>So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew</a>, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jason-sudeikis-travis-kelce.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce Visibly Uncomfortable As Jason Sudeikis Makes Jokes About Him Marrying Taylor Swift">Travis Kelce Visibly Uncomfortable As Jason Sudeikis Makes Jokes About Him Marrying Taylor Swift</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce had to ask Jason Sudeikis to stop joking about his relationship with Taylor Swift after a Harrison Butker reference.</p><p>She also clarified a myth about their first date. "<strong>By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple</strong>. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date. When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care. The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone.<strong> And we’re just proud of each other</strong>."</p><p>Sorry Sam Heughan, but it's unlikely that Jamie Fraser will stand a chance against this meet-cute.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimrqyclrulsdFmqpqlXZ2ytrPHmqVmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kYrG2uc9mq6uZpp7AbrfEpZqeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
