However, she has had quite the relationship life, linked to a few other familiar faces along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She ended this particular relationship on good terms, as the two still speak today. We'll take a look at what went on between Heidi Klum And Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis during their brief time together.</p><h2 id=anthony-kiedis-is-an-iconic-rocker>Anthony Kiedis Is An Iconic Rocker</h2><p>Since breaking out back in the 1990s, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have been one of the biggest and most successful bands on the planet. No matter who's playing guitar for them at the moment, the band has consistently released music that has sold millions of records, and at this point, they are legends of the genre.</p><p>Anthony Kiedis is the group's iconic singer, and though he may not have the best pipes in the business his voice and style are unique and instantly recognizable. The same can be said about his lyrics, which range from silly and nonsensical, to gorgeous and haunting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Kiedis may not be considered an A-list celebrity, he has had the luck of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating some major stars</a> throughout the years. Kiedis has been linked to stars like Ione Skye, Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star, Sinead O'Connor, Sofia Coppola, Mel C of the Spice Girls, and allegedly even Demi Moore. Throw on a slew of models, and it's clear that Kiedis fancies himself a ladies man.</p><p>At one point, he was even linked to one of the most beautiful women on the planet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How The 'Red Hot Chili Peppers' Signed A $140 Million Deal</a></span></p><h2 id=heidi-klum-is-a-legendary-model>Heidi Klum Is A Legendary Model</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this point, Heidi Klum is as legendary in the world of modeling as Kiedis is in the world of rock music. She's an icon, and through the years, Klum has been a powerhouse in the industry thanks to a variety of endeavors.</p><p>Being a super model is an achievement in its own right, but we can't ignore the fact that Klum was also dynamic while serving as the host of Project Runway. The series was a colossal success, and you had better believe that it helped turned Heidi Klum into one of the most famous women in the world.</p><p>Klum is currently hosting Making the Cut, which has some differences from her former hit show.</p><p>"When you see a design that you actually love, you can buy it. It's not only great for the consumer, but it's also amazing for our designers. We never had that aspect where we could actually help the designers to really branch out into the real world like this on 'Project Runway,'" she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, it's not uncommon to see rockers and models collide in a romance, and this is exactly what took place many, many years ago</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Anthony Kiedis Spends His Red Hot $140 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-them>What Happened Between Them</h2><p>For a short time, Anthony Kiedis and Heidi Klum were linked together. The romance came on the heels of Klum getting a divorce. The romance with Kiedis was something that wasn't highly-publicized, and though it was short-lived, they still shared a piece of their lives together.</p><p>Years after their brief romance ended, Kiedis opened up about it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a>.</p><p>"The hottest woman in the world was my girlfriend, that made me really proud. I saw her and immediately fell in love with her," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer would then offer some details as to why things didn't work out.</p><p>According to Kiedis, "I was at that time a selfish ass, Heidi had just come from a broken marriage."</p><p>"A man can be happy, with a woman like her at his side. She is not only beautiful, but also intelligent, a successful business woman, and great mother," he added.</p><p>Eventually, Klum caught wind of Kiedis' words, and she was open and honest about her feelings regarding the Red Hot Chili Peppers singer.</p><p>"Obviously, it’s very nice when you still get along with your ex in a way or someone you have dated in the past. And you know, we had a very special time together. I never really thought that anyone knew anything about that. It’s funny that he brings it up after so many years," Klum said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Nasty Did Seal And Heidi Klum's Divorce Get?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's honestly refreshing to see that these two maintain some semblance of appreciation for one another. It can be easy to hold onto resentment, but time tends to heal all, and Kiedis and Klum can fondly reflect on their time together.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Heidi Klum's Daughter, Leni, And Her Personal Life</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmoJWesap5yqWspmWRo7FuvsSdZKGnpGKwqbXLomSpnaClsrO%2FjKygp5%2BVp3qiutOhpqexXaC2prDIrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
