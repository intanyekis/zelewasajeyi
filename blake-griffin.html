Many people call him “the human highlight reel” because he can dunk over people like no one else can, in the whole NBA league.</p><p>His leg power and upper body strength are a result of hours spent on working both in on-season and off-season. Blake says –</p><p>“There’s no shortcut to success. My vertical jump didn’t reach this far overnight. I’ve spent hours, months and years working on my body, and I still do it on a regular basis. Staying in shape all year long is what every player should focus upon. It’s good on a long run and it gets you ready for the playoffs.”</p><p>Blake points towards his unique workouts on the sand dunes, which as he says are responsible for his great leg power and vertical jumping abilities. In his own words –</p><p>“Every summer is the same story. I go on the sand dunes and run up and down. My trainer often pushes me to run with 20 kg vest. Trust me, there is nothing better than working on the sand dunes. Neither lifting 2x bodyweight squats or deadlift can provide such intensity as sand dunes can.”</p><h3><strong>Blake Griffin Favorite Things</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Cereal – </strong>Golden Grahams</li><li><strong>TV Character – </strong>Michael Scott (The Office)</li><li><strong>Chick Flick – </strong>Crazy, Stupid, Love.
