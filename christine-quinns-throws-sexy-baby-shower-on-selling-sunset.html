A shower under the stars, complete with amazing florals and exotic animals that seamlessly fit the jungle theme. I absolutely love working with Christine because she has a very definitive vision of what she wants and she gives me full faith and free-range to take her ideas and bring them to life, creatively.”</p><p>The Texas native shared photos from her shower via Instagram at the time, including the Passion Fruit Placenta, Push Present Piña Colada and Baby Mama Mojito drinks that were served.</p><p>Christian, the reality star’s first child with husband <strong>Christian Richard</strong>, arrived later that same month after an emergency C-section.</p><p>“Welcome Baby C,” Quinn gushed in a May Instagram upload. “I could not feel more in love, blessed, and grateful. Words can not express the joy of being a mommy.”</p><p>The little one’s <a href=#>birth was “excruciating,”</a> she told her Instagram followers two months later.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“After my water broke the day I was filming, I was rushed to the hospital already 9cm dilated. Hyperventilating from the pain, I was immediately rushed in to an emergency crash C-section due to both our heart rates instantly plummeting,” the new mom wrote in July. “Baby C’s umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. Baby C was seconds away from not making it. The surgeons didn’t even have time to count their tools before stitching me up as I was flatlining. They ran me through the X-ray machine immediately after surgery to ensure there was no remaining tools left in my body. I am so grateful for the doctors and surgeons that saved BOTH of us.”</p><p>Season 4 of Selling Sunset is available to stream now on Netflix.
