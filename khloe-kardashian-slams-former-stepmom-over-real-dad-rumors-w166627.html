In a new preview for the Wednesday, March 9, episode of <i>Kocktails With Khloé</i>, the reality star takes aim at one of her late father’s former spouses who made claims that Robert Kardashian was not Khloé’s real dad.</p><p>“I think the thing that most became overwhelming was when, like, the stuff happened with one of my dad’s wives,” the <i>Strong Looks Better Naked</i> author, 31, says during a discussion about the dark side of fame. “She wanted to come out, like, 10 years later after my dad passed away and said that I’m not his daughter and that he confided in her and blah-say-blah.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>While she fails to mention a name, it’s most likely that Khloé is talking about </span><span>Ellen Pierson</span><span>, Robert’s ex-wife who sold excerpts from his private diary to a tabloid in 2013 — a decade after the lawyer’s 2003 death at age 59 from esophageal cancer. In an accompanying interview, Pierson said that Robert openly admitted to her that he wasn’t Khloé’s biological parent.</span></p><p>“I was like, ‘Listen, you can talk about me and my sisters all you f–king want,’” the talk-show host adds in the clip. “Do not talk about my dad.… He’s not here!”</p><p>On February 22, Khloé took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to pay tribute to Robert on what would have been his 72nd birthday. “To the best man I’ve ever known, happy birthday daddy,” she captioned an adorable throwback pic of her younger self with her father. “I miss you! I miss you! I miss you! Man… I wish we had more pictures together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>Robert’s name has been back in the news since the premiere of FX’s new miniseries, </span><i>American Crime Story: The People v.
