Ford was injured in the crash after her Jeep was reportedly clipped by an 18-wheeler. The truck didn’t stop, but many other pedestrians&nbsp;did to help pull the 41-year-old out of the wreckage.</p><p>In an accompanying post, Ford went into the detail about how the EMT and other drivers essentially saved her life.</p><p>“Due to my skull fracture and concussion, there are parts I may never remember. What I do know now, after seeing photos and hearing the accounts from people that came to my rescue before the EMT’s, is that some incredible human beings stopped to pull me from the wreckage of my Jeep, risking their lives not knowing if the car was at risk of catching fire,” she said. “They removed their own clothing to place under and around my head to hold the gaping wound to my skull closed and held a hat over my face to shield me from the sun. Just days before, I had been having a moment where I feared for humanity. Where it seemed we were more interested in capturing a moment rather than helping a soul in need. My fears were put to rest, by the quick thinking and compassionate actions of the Good Samaritans that helped me, the fast-acting EMT workers and trauma staff and Huntington Memorial hospital and by the overwhelming outpouring of support that I’ve received from people all over the world. I’m humbled by the love and care and concern I’ve received.”</p><p>Friend and fellow model/actress Claudia Jordan created a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GoFundMe</a> for Ford’s medical expenses. So far, fans have raised over $20,000.</p><p>“Much appreciation to all the people who have sent well wishes, prayed for Melyssa & also thank you to the people that donated to her <a href=# id=auto-tag_gofundme_1 data-tag=gofundme>GoFundMe</a>,” Jordan shared on Instagram Sunday (July 29). “You all are too sweet and are so appreciated. Life is short my friends—- let’s spend our days here showing more love and support and less negativity!”</p><p>Watch Ford’s message below.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BET’s ‘VIXEN’ Documentary Shines A Light On The Legacy Of Video Girls</a></strong></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6KyrcXSrJhmnp%2BnsW66xJqpZp6Rqa6tecKaqWaZk5i2pbHNrWSuqJSWwaZ5lHJvcW1mZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
