Age, Brother, Height, Is He Gay?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Nathan Schwandt shot into the limelight for being the boyfriend of the transgender pop singer, Jeffree Star. Why not? Star himself is a social media influencer who operates a YouTube channel with about 4 million subscribers and millions of views too. It would’ve been much different had Jeffree Star kept his love life away from media. But with that much following and lots of points to prove, Nathan Schwandt became Star’s statement of “Hey, transgender love can be cool too.” More than that, Schwandt has been a major player in his partner’s life.</p><p>He once oversaw the shipping department of Jeffree’s cosmetic company, Jeffree Star Cosmetics, and also modeled for various products of the company. More so, Nathan has collaborated with Jeffree on the Starr Family makeup collection line. What’s more? He even plays the guitar. If it’s Jeffree Star’s partner you’re looking for, search nowhere else. Let’s bring you details of all he is and what he does. Ready?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nathan-schwandts-age-%e2%80%93-who-is-he></span><strong>Nathan Schwandt’s Age – Who Is He?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nathan Schwandt was born in Michigan, United States, on August 18, 1993. He, alongside his younger brother, Zach, was raised in America’s Midwest. Although there are no details about his childhood, early education, parents, and what they do for a living, we know that he has a thing for skateboarding and playing the guitar. We also know that, before striking gold, he worked at a Michigan pet shop.</p><p>However, things change really fast for the young chap after he received a direct message from Jeffree Star in 2015. From an exchange on Instagram over time, Jeffree invited Nathan over to Los Angeles for their first hook up; the rest they say is history.<br>Nathan would eventually leave Michigan to go settle near his newfound love in Los Angeles.</p><p>He began working to expand Jeffree’s cosmetics company, Jeffree Star Cosmetics. After working in that capacity for a while, Nathan left work to go focus on tending their home and five dogs; Diva, Diamond, Daddy, Delicious, and Drama. They regard the animals as their “babies”.</p><p>Its been about five years now, and they’re no signs of trouble or splits. The couple has made joint investments initiatives in marijuana and currently own houses in Michigan, Nathan’s home state.</p><p>So far, it has not been a fair ride for the young chap, seeing his conservative background and the stigma he continues to attract. With some labeling him a cheap gold digger who only agreed to date Jeffree for pecuniary gains and not necessarily because he was gay all along. In spite of the hullabaloos, Nathan Schwandt has stuck fast to his partner, Jeffree Star. If anything has happened to their relationship, it’s the increasing trust. They even boast to know each other’s phone passwords.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-brother></span><strong>His Brother&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Asides that they are based in Michigan, nothing is known about Nathan Schwandt’s family. We have no details about the name of his parents, what they do for a living, and what their religious affiliations are. We know, however, that they have two sons and that Nathan is the first.</p><p>His younger brother Zach also works with Jeffree Star Cosmetics. He moved over to Los Angeles to stay with his brother and his partner for a while. Zach also commands a healthy following on Instagram.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-nathan-schwandt-truly-gay></span><strong>Is Nathan Schwandt Truly Gay?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to sources, Nathan’s family have been quite supportive of their sons’ relationship with Jeffree, which have given them quite some approval in the LGBT community. But many still disagree with his gay status, seeing his relationship history.</p><p>A lazy dig through his dating history shows that he only dated women in the past. This further lent weight to speculations that he chose to date Jeffree simply for the money. Nathan won’t let it slide. He explained that prior to dating Jeffree, he was still shy and timid about his gay orientation because he was locked up in a highly conservative setting back in Michigan; as such, he dated girls. However, he has been a lot prouder and bolder about his identity since he began dating Jeffree.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-other-body-measurement></span><strong>Height and Other Body Measurement</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Now in his mid-twenties, Nathan Schwandt maintains a sturdy build. He stands at 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters) and weighs 154 lb (72 Kg). Nathan has brown hair and hazel eyes; he also wears an array of tattoos and a shoe size of 8 (US). His biceps measure 14 inches.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKaRqbWiuoysmqGvkaOxtXnWoaZmoaNitaZ5wKCcZpqipMGpsdFmn56hl53BbrXSZp%2BeZZeWxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
