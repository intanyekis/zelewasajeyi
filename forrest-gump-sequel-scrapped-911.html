Released in 1994, the plot follows the exploits of Forrest Gump, played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hanks</a>. If you haven't seen it by now then really, where have you been? Anyway, the movie was critically acclaimed and won no fewer than six Academy&nbsp;Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fast forward to today where it feels as if almost every single movie release is either a remake or a sequel of some sort. The Star Wars movies are back, the Ghostbusters franchise has been rebooted, even the Marvel Cinematic Universe is based on what has happened in previously written comic books. With the success Forrest Gump enjoyed upon its release in the mid-90s, why has there been no follow up?</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>BLOCKBUSTER IN OREGON WILL BE THE LAST ONE LEFT BY THE END OF THIS MONTH</a></strong></p><p>Well, there was, sort of. Long before Hollywood became obsessed with reboots and sequels, Forrest Gump's screenwriter Eric Roth wrote an entire script for the follow-up to his award-winning classic. However, the timing of his hand in is where this plan falls apart. September 10, 2001. The day before 9/11, a tragedy that would change the very course of history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like us, you might be questioning why 9/11 would derail the progression of a movie. Well, the content of the never-created Forrest Gump 2 might have something to do with that. Roth revealed that the script included Forrest being inserted into specific instances in human history, much like the first. Those moments included the movie's protagonist somehow finding himself in the back of <a href=#>OJ Simpson</a>'s car, and also dancing with Princess Diana at a charity event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roth revealed that Hanks and the movie's producers decided that the significance of the terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001, would have rendered the sequel and what would have happened in the movie irrelevant. One thing is for sure, it would have been a wild ride. On top of everything mentioned above, Roth revealed that the focus of the film would be around Forrest Jr. and his struggle with AIDS. Even without the historical significance of that time in history, that would have been a tough sell.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>GOOGLE FINED $1.7 BILLION FOR BLOCKING RIVAL ADVERTISERS</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8Woqaudo6l6qMHMqWSsnaGqsq150pypmqigmrFuhZBqZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
