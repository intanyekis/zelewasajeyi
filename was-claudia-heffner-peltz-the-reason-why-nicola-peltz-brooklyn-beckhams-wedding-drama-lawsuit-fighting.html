I think the only thing would be that if someone were to come up to talk to me or whatever, he’s like, “We’re married.” You know what I mean?"</p><p>Nicola continued to Cosmopolitan, "It’s more official as opposed to when you’re dating someone and you’re like, “Hey, that’s my boyfriend.” But in my head, I’m 14, so when I call myself a wife, I’m like, What? What’s going on? I’m literally a teen.
