A source exclusively told Us that Madix, 37, and Sandoval were <a href=#>experiencing issues for some time</a> before the twosome ultimately called it quits.</p><p>“They were having problems for a while,” the insider shared, adding that things “only came to a breaking point” the day before their split was announced.</p><p>Kennedy, for his part, dated Leviss for five years and even proposed to her in May 2021 with the help of Sandoval. The pair <a href=#>called off their engagement</a> seven months later.</p><p>Shortly after news of Sandoval and Madix’s split, Kennedy shared a <a href=#>screenshot of an article about the breakup</a> via his Instagram in a now-deleted post. “Hope you all feel as sick as I do. This explains everything,” he wrote at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/James-Kennedy-Returns-to-%E2%80%98Vanderpump-Rules-to-Film-Interview-Titled-%E2%80%98Scandoval-Amid-Tom-Sandoval-and-Raquel-Leviss-Affair-285.jpg><p>After his original post, Kennedy took to his Instagram Story <a href=#>to encourage fans</a> to “bring the tomatoes and the cabbage” to the Tom Sandoval & the Most Extras concert that evening.</p><p>Following the news of his affair, the Missouri native asked that his friends, family and <a href=#>businesses</a> be <a href=#>spared from the scrutiny</a>.</p><p>“Hey, I fully understand [and] deserve ur anger & disappointment towards me, but please leave Schwartz, my friends and family out of this situation … Schwartz specifically only found out about this very recently, and most definitely did not condone my actions. This was a very personal thing,” he wrote via Instagram on Saturday, March 4.</p><p>While Leviss hasn’t acknowledged the controversy yet, this isn’t the first time that she has been the center of<a href=#> drama amongst the Bravo personalities</a>. Following <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a>’s 2022 divorce, the California native and Schwartz, 40, <a href=#>made out</a> while attending <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brock Davies</strong></a>‘ August wedding.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The drama is currently playing out on <a href=#>season 10 of the reality series</a>. Ahead of the premiere, Schwartz exclusively told Us he <a href=#>did not have any regrets</a> about hooking up with Leviss.</p><p>“In the moment, there was momentary passion in the air. I kind of disappeared into that kiss, I’ll be honest. It was kind of a transformative moment,” he gushed in February. “In terms of any long-term romance with me and Raquel, I don’t know how much chemistry is there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeupaBiv7a4xKxko5mdmsBut8SnpZ6cqWKzqrjMrGSfp6JiwKStzZ2mr5mcYrGmwMCio6xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
