I don’t like fighting with people,” he said, referring to his&nbsp;“Real Housewives”&nbsp;franchises.</p><p>“Well, we’re not.

I was on my radio show yesterday, and I said, ‘You know, Anderson typically … when one of us sees Ryan behind us … one of us will nudge the other and say, ‘Hey, there’s Seacrest. Look, there’s Ryan,’ so the other one can make note and give a wave, and I said, ‘This year you did not do that! … Now look what you’ve done, Anderson.’”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen pose for a selfie during the Times Square New Year’s Eve 2023 Celebration on Dec. 31. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest appear on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” on Sept. 21, 2017. <span class=credit>NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via</span></figure><p>Seacrest and Cohen were able to laugh at that excuse, and Seacrest mentioned the three men should “cheers next year after the shows.”</p><p>Cohen tried to explain the order of events on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirius XM</a> show Wednesday, even calling Cooper to clarify the New Year’s Eve greeting debacle.</p><p>“Oh, you’re gonna get me involved in a thing with Seacrest.
