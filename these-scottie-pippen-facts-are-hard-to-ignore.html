Scottie Pippen's NBA career has long been under-appreciated by mass audiences who have witnessed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a>'s greatness in real-time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The blessing stems from having the luxury to be a participant in history, i.e., a member of one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest NBA dynasties</a> who were followed everywhere like the Beatles, and on the other hand, the curse comes from Pippen's greatness being diminished as a result of the perceived Batman and Robin relationship; the notion that sidekicks cannot save the day without help from the hero.</p><p>While winning 6 NBA championships can certainly satisfy one's sense of achievement, the human ego is only natural, especially in the professional sports field. And unfortunately for Pippen's legacy, he didn't leave the Chicago Bulls until he was past his prime. Taking time to analyze some of his key career moments, here are some Scottie Pippen facts that are hard to ignore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=contract-ranking-across-the-nba><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Contract Ranking Across the NBA</span></h2><p>By the 1997-1998 season, the Bulls' dynasty was on its last legs. Butting heads with Jerry Krause over the disrespect he felt he had endured (Krause publically said he was listening to trade offers) at the time, per The Last Dance documentary, Pippen was ranked 122nd in the NBA in salary despite being 2nd on the Bulls in minutes played, and 1st in the Bulls in steals and assists.</p><h2 id=listed-as-6-1-in-high-school><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Listed As&nbsp;6'1" In High School</span></h2><p>Playing point guard for Hamburg High School as a teenager, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottie Pippen</a> was listed as 6'1" and was never offered a scholarship. Basketball appeared to not be a part of his future, so when he attended the University of Arkansas, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">served as&nbsp;the basketball team's equipment manager</a>. By his senior year, Pippen experienced a late 7-inch growth spurt, and upon earning a spot on the team, he transformed into the point-forward we all now know and love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-draft-night-backstory><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The Draft Night Backstory</span></h2><p>Krause had been scouting Pippen for a long time.&nbsp;Intrigued by his wingspan and guard abilities, Krause tried to keep his interest private. Unlike the attention every prospect receives today, back then, hidden gems could&nbsp;sometimes remain unknown. When Sam Smith discovered Krause's&nbsp;prospect and reported it, he was scolding by Krause for exposing his hand and was forced to move up in the draft to which we now recognize as the Seattle trade for the 5th pick.</p><h2 id=was-financially-rewarded-when-the-bulls-traded-him><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Was Financially Rewarded When the Bulls Traded Him</span></h2><p>Pippen was undeniably underpaid for 7 years due to a handful of circumstances. Besides management's refusal to renegotiate, the salary cap was also much smaller in 1991 and only grew through time. That said, when the Bulls' dynasty core broke up and Pippen was granted his trade request to be moved to Houston, as Bulls insider K.C. Johnson pointed out, Pippen was essentially given a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$25 million dollar going away present in the incentivized sign and trade deal</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Current NBA Contracts That Make No Sense (And 5 That Are A Steal)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=close-to-being-traded-for-tracy-mcgrady><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Close to Being&nbsp;Traded&nbsp;For Tracy McGrady</span></h2><p>Tracy McGrady has long reported on The Jump&nbsp;that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Krause was working behind the scenes to acquire him at the 1997 draft</a>. Though Michael Jordan vetoed the trade, it can definitely be strange to analyze the transaction in hindsight: an older Pippen who was battling a bad back being traded for a raw prospect who would go on to become a Hall of Famer, but whose window of dominance peaked at 28 due to injuries.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Star Athletes Who Got Injured And Never Returned To Prior Form</a></span></p><h2 id=the-1991-1992-season-was-a-thrill-for-him><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The&nbsp;1991-1992&nbsp;Season Was A Thrill For Him</span></h2><p>Fresh off of winning an NBA championship, in 1992, Scottie Pippen had a terrific season and proved he was a star on the rise. He made his first All-Star team, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All-Defensive First-Team</a>, won a second championship, and to top it all off, he ended the summer by representing his country on the infamous USA Dream Team and winning a gold medal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-of-the-nba-s-50-greatest-players><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>One Of The NBA's 50 Greatest Players</span></h2><p>The argument is often made that had Scottie Pippen not played with Michael Jordan, he likely would have&nbsp;remained a first-ballot Hall of Famer but wouldn't have been named one of the 50 greatest players. Regardless, the fact of the matter is, Jordan wasn't able to get over the hump until Pippen's improved and provided Jordan with another scoring threat.</p><h2 id=george-karl-almost-became-his-head-coach><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>George Karl Almost Became His Head Coach</span></h2><p>Anyone that follows David Kaplan is well-aware that he's had a very interesting basketball journey.&nbsp;A former assistant coach and NBA scout who is now the host of ESPN 1000, Kaplan shocked listeners when he announced the underreported story of the Bulls verbally agreeing&nbsp;to trade away Pippen for Shawn Kemp in the summer of 1994. Facing fan backlash and ticket cancellations when Kaplan broke the story on-air, the Sonics' front office backed out at the last minute.</p><h2 id=pippen-s-1994-semi-finals-tantrum><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Pippen's 1994 Semi-Finals Tantrum</span></h2><p>Pippen's career is unfairly defined by living in Jordan's shadow. Having an MVP caliber season during the 1993-1994 season, when the Bulls faced off against the Knicks in the semi-finals and were down 2-0 in the series, Pippen was furious when he discovered Phil Jackson had drawn up the final play for Toni Kukoc. Cursing out Jackson and refusing to return to the game, the Bulls went on to win the game after a Kukoc buzzer-beater.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jordan-couldn-t-win-a-playoff-series-without-him><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jordan Couldn't Win A Playoff Series Without Him</span></h2><p>No one would have guessed that a shy, skinny forward from the University of Arkansas would transform into one of the&nbsp;greatest&nbsp;two-way players in the world. And as crazy as it is to admit, in the early part of Jordan's career, the narrative was that Jordan was simply a phenomenal scorer who couldn't win championships. While Pippen was inconsistent during his rookie year, Jordan's first-round exits ended immediately following Pippen's NBA debut.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Photos Describe Michael Jordan's Career</a></span></p><h2 id=made-10-all-defensive-teams><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Made 10 All-Defensive Teams</span></h2><p>Scottie Pippen is arguably one of the greatest, if not the greatest, on-ball defenders in NBA history. Having a large wingspan and enormous hands, Pippen made a career on chase-down blocks, steals, and guarding the opposing team's best perimeter scoring threat. Making <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All-Defensive First-Team eight times and Second-Team twice</a>, Pippen tragically never won the Defensive Player of The Year award likely due to how big man favored the award is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-a-member-of-the-portland-jailblazers><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Was A Member of The Portland JailBlazers</span></h2><p>The Portland Trailblazers had a talented group in the early 2000s. For a young core that included Rasheed Wallace, Damon Stoudemire, and Bonzi Wells, rest assured, the additions of veterans Pippen and Smith were only going to help. That first year, the Blazers made it to the WCF, but after losing to the Lakers, it went straight downhill from there.&nbsp;Roster changes occurred that off-season and off-court drama earned them the nickname "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jailblazers</a>."</p><h2 id=won-1994-all-star-game-mvp><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Won 1994 All-Star Game MVP</span></h2><p>With Jordan retiring and pursuing a baseball career, the 1993-1994 season was the first time Scottie Pippen experienced being the go-to guy on a team. And he surely didn't disappoint. He led to the Bulls to a 55 and 27 record and won the 1994 All-Star game MVP after having a double-double: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">29 points and 11 rebounds</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pippen-shifted-the-1991-finals-series><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Pippen Shifted the 1991 Finals Series</span></h2><p>Finally managing to dethrone their arch-nemesis, in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Boy Pistons</a>, a 29-year-old Jordan was determined to capitalize on the opportunity to win his first championship. Facing off against a Laker team that was on the tail end of the "Showtime" era, Jordan guarded Johnson the first game.&nbsp;After losing a tight game and trailing 1-0, the much taller Pippen took on the challenge and picked up Johnson full court, which immediately shifted the momentum of the series.</p><h2 id=made-ewing-into-a-poster><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Made Ewing Into A Poster</span></h2><p>One of Pippen's all-time greatest moments: with the Bulls on a fast break, Pippen made sure to provide proper spacing for B.J. Armstrong and Pete Myers. When Myers made the extra pass, realizing Patrick Ewing was rotating to contest, Pippen posterized him, stepped over him, and taunted die-hard Knicks fan, Spike Lee, in the stands.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Photos Scottie Pippen Can't Stop Looking At Of Larsa Younan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnq0r86tq6KdXaW2sbzEp2SfmZOpwG6t0Z5koZmimXq1u4yinqenopp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
