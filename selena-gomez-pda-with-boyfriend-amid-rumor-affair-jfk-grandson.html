This power move has proven to be incredibly lucrative for her.</p><p>Schlossberg is a lawyer who graduated from Harvard University. But for those thinking this was a great coupling, Gomez saw the chatter and quickly shut down the idea. In response to a post on Instagram about publications linking her and Schlossberg, Gomez commented, "Never met this human sorry." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She quickly ended any further gossip</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-have-selena-gomez-39-s-fans-said-about-the-dating-rumors>What Have Selena Gomez's Fans Said About The Dating Rumors?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/selena-gomez-boyfriend-1.jpg><p><strong>Fans had previously reacted to the post, though, with some comparing Schlossberg to her current boyfriend, Bennie Blanco</strong>. "This Kennedy guy was a better option than her present!" one comment reads. Another fan wrote, "I love Selena, but I think Selena is a hopeless romantic and falls for any guy that is a little nice to her."</p><p>Other fans showed their support. "@selenagomez, these rumors are CRAZY. Well, either way, Love you, girl," one comment reads. But there was also a lot of confusion. "Wait, what?

"I think most of my experiences in relationships have been cursed. I've been way too young to be exposed to certain things when I was in relationships," she told Vogue Australia in an interview in 2021.</p><p>"I guess I needed to find what was that word for me because I felt so less than in past relationships and never really felt equal," Gomez continued about why she named her makeup line Rare Beauty. "And so that word to me – when I first heard it [used in the single Rare] with Nolan [Lambroza], one of the writers, I just said this is what I want to feel about myself. So it wasn't even necessarily like: 'Oh, I feel that way, let me sing it.' It was almost like: 'Actually, I need to feel that way about myself.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>However, she appears to finally have found the man she was meant to be with (although only time will tell if that is true).

"They are so in love," an insider told People in April 2024. "It's a very serious relationship, and they're making long-distance work while she's in New York for work commitments."</p><p>The insider continued, "Benny makes her feel special, and they try to see each other as much as possible.
