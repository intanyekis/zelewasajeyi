Some people get it and some people don't. Whether it be stamps, trains, trading cards, or something else, chances are there are people out there who collect just about anything. However, nothing is quite as sought after as famous memorabilia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether it be autographs, photos, or items that a celebrity has worn or used, if it can be linked to a famous face then chances are someone will be willing to pay a lot of money for it. That was proved last week via an auction for some items once owned by Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. Among those items was a pretty iconic guitar, a guitar that was sold for a lot of money.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kurt Cobain's Daughter Hopes Her Father Would Be Proud Of Her</a></span></p><p>And we mean a lot of money. So much money that it has now become the most expensive guitar in the world. Australian businessman Peter Freedman is now the proud owner of Cobain's old instrument, and it cost him $6.01 million to earn that honor. There were only seven bids in total which were expected to fall somewhere between $1 million and $2 million. Freedman told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PA News Agency</a> he was "scared sh*tless and shaking" come the end of the auction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So why is this guitar so valuable, we hear you ask? Aside from the fact it once belonged to the legendary Kurt Cobain, of course. It's because it was the guitar Cobain used during what has gone on to become a legendary performance on MTV Unplugged. Part of it can be watched above, which also shows off the guitar Freedman is now the proud owner of.</p><p>Freedman plans on touring with the guitar to highlight the plight of artists around the world, something more relevant than ever right now. He will then sell the instrument and use the money to continue to shine a spotlight on that cause. As for what is now the second most expensive guitar in the world, that&nbsp;belonged to Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and sold for $3.95 million just last year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Tiger King Star Claims There Are Bodies Buried Under Carole Baskin's New Zoo</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nm6q%2FtXnCqJmaoZ5itLa105qpZpmlmMGqu81mbWalmaG5qrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
