After only one year with then-head coach Jimbo Fisher and the Seminoles, he transferred to Independence (Kan.) Community College. Seasons three and four of Netflix’s ‘Last Chance U’ focused on Independence CC.</p><p>Henry’s coach, Jason Brown, is a divisive figure. The intricate dynamic between Henry and Brown was a high point of Season 3. Henry played for two years at Independence CC before making the move to Nevada.</p><p>He played with the Wolf Pack for one season (2019), during which he threw for 593 yards and one touchdown while also throwing four interceptions in three games. Henry has been out of the public eye since his season with Nevada ended, but he has just resurfaced.</p><p>Henry has agreed to play with the Indoor Football League’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Frisco Fighters</a>. His time on the football field apparently isn’t done with him just yet. Malik Henry’s name may now be seen on the roster of the Frisco Fighters. Find out what the team has to say about their new quarterback below.</p><p>For the Fighters, Henry is one of three potential quarterback options. Meanwhile, Frisco has a perfect 2-0 record thus far this year.</p><h2>As of the season, Malik Henry has not signed with a football team.</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/henry-e1652721784675-1140x640-1-1024x575.jpg alt="As of the season, Malik Henry has not signed with a football team." width=1024 height=575 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Although the University of Nevada was his first choice, Henry had his heart set on playing for a Power Five institution. The truth is that Nevada was taking a risk on Henry, and the gamble never paid off. Henry started two of the three games in which he participated for the World Pack in 2019.</p><p>The Nevada head coach cut Henry from the team due to his off-field antics, showing deeper-rooted behavioral issues. Though he wasn’t officially cut, the quarterback bowed out of team activities before the start of spring camp in 2020.</p><p>The former Last Chance U football standout has not transferred to another school yet (as of August 2020). If he decides to transfer, he can do so without losing his eligibility for a full year.</p><p>Henry may have to wait longer because of the widespread of the coronavirus, regardless of whether he is currently considering his alternatives. Despite the fact that several college football leagues have delayed their 2020 seasons, it is still uncertain whether or not rescheduled games will be played next spring.</p><p>Henry’s brilliance is undeniable, but the moral flaws that come with him pose a danger that may discourage many schools from pursuing him.</p><h2>Henry is coy about his future beyond Nevada.</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/malikhenry-e1634242147401-1024x576.jpeg alt="Henry is coy about his future beyond Nevada." width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Henry, who has been the starting quarterback for the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Nevada Wolf Pack</a>, has been mum about his future plans. Henry has reportedly not settled down anywhere since leaving Nevada, according to the Last Chance U Alum Twitter account. The window of opportunity for Henry is still open for another year.</p><p>Last Chance U Alum stated that since Malik Henry left the Nevada football team in January, he has failed to make an impact at any other collegiate football programs. There is still one year remaining on Malik’s eligibility, thus he can choose to attend either Florida State, Independence Community College, or the University of Nevada.</p><p>For the first time since January of this year, Henry has completely disappeared from Twitter. Henry excelled in his first spring game at Nevada in 2019, and he later remarked that the coaching staff “treated me like family.”</p><p>Henry told Nevada Sports Net, “These coaches are fantastic.” On my first day, I was greeted like a long-lost relative and given the warmest possible treatment. Many other locations may claim to do this, but I really experienced it here.</p><p>Of all the other locations I’ve traveled to, Nevada is the only one where I’ve seen the principles they teach put into action. Thank you so much to any coach who gave me a chance. I’m grateful that the judges didn’t treat me any differently because of my history with the program.</p><p>To sum up, I’m grateful to them and the rest of the team for welcoming me, and my experience with them has been excellent thus far. I’m content with my current situation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8rq3LoqJmoJWjv7p51qGcq51dnsButMRmpaivX2aDdoORaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
