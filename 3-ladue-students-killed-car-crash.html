We take it student by student to make sure they get the support they need.”</p><p>The high school has made counselors available for any student who may need some emotional support during this difficult time, and a candlelight vigil is planned before this weekend’s football game.</p><p>Parents and neighbors of the victims have expressed their grief and noted that these boys were good kids who made a bad decision.&nbsp;</p><p>Jenn Bugg, a parent of one of the victims’ friends, said, “It could have been any of our kids.
