It seems that <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">every goal that he ever set his sights on was achieved.</a> He is able to boast successes that the average person can only ever dream of. He has accomplished so many incredible things in life that had fans not actually witnessed his journey; it would be difficult to believe that he had actually done them all. He's a highly esteemed and incredibly successful actor,<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a former professional bodybuilder,</a> a businessman, producer, and former politician who reigned supreme as the 38th Governor of California. With <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an astounding net worth of $400 million</a>, Arnold Schwarzenegger can afford to splurge on anything his heart desires, and it seems he has an affinity for fine cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=excalibur-89-000>Excalibur: $89,000</h2><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One of the unique vehicles in Schwarzenegger's collection</a> happens to be a classic vehicle that stands out among any others on the road. This vehicle is a re-creation of the Mercedes Benz SSK and oozes originality and class. It's a definite head-turner due to its vintage look and impressive styling. This vehicle is not a common choice for celebrities, and seeing Schwarzenegger behind the wheel makes it even more special. He dropped a cool $89,000 to be noticed in this ride.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold Schwarzenegger & Maria Shriver's Former Home Listed For $11 Million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tesla-roadster-100-000>Tesla Roadster: $100,000</h2><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger had a Tesla before the brand was popularized. He was quick to the punch when he snagged <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the first Tesla Model S cars </a>that ever went into production - the Roadster. This particular model was one of the first-ever fully electric cars off the line and was actually a huge flop for the Tesla brand. It lacked horsepower and was only able to push through to 248 hp upon its initial release. The current Roadster on the market has certainly seen huge improvements. Arnold spent $100,000 to be among the first to claim ownership of this environmentally friendly ride.</p><h2 id=hummer-h1-slant-back-150-000>Hummer H1 Slant Back: $150,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger has an eclectic collection of vehicles, and among the most beasty of them, all is the Hummer H1 Slant Back that set him back $150,000. He opted for a light beige-colored model, which perfectly suits the brand and lends it the appearance of an aggressive vehicle that can handle any type of terrain. Schwarzenegger was often seen in this H1 and fully enjoyed his ability to drive this rugged vehicle.</p><h2 id=custom-audi-r8-180-000>Custom Audi R8: $180,000</h2><p>Arnold is also attracted to the sleek styling and corner-hugging <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">capabilities of the Audi R8</a>. This speedy vehicle is among the top performers on the track and can reach impressive speeds with ease. Of course, Arnold took his Audi R8 ownership to the next level by fully customizing his car, inclusive of both aesthetic and performance-based enhancements. Fully designed to suit his every need, the cost of this Audi quickly skyrocketed to $180,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bentley-continental-gtc-208-000>Bentley Continental GTC: $208,000</h2><p>The incredible fleet of cars owned by Arnold Schwarzenegger includes some of the finest cars ever made, and his Bentley Continental GTC is among the most incredible machines in his possession. He fully customized this vehicle, too, and did a full-color change on it, turning it into a silver bullet made to take on the road. This car is powered by a V8 engine that combines both speed and styling, leading to a $208,000 price tag.</p><h2 id=porsche-911-turbo-cabriolet-250-000>Porsche&nbsp;911 Turbo Cabriolet: $250,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the finest, most recognized cars </a>in his collection is the stunning Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet that Arnold Schwarzenegger is often spotted in. This incredible vehicle has an electrically powered wind deflector that extends or retracts in just 2 seconds with the simple press of a button. This gives the car increased speed capacity and aerodynamics, lending to its ability to hit its maximum speed of 205 mph with a 0-60 time of fewer than 2.7 seconds. Schwarzenegger didn't hesitate to invest $250,000 for this beauty.</p><h2 id=bentley-continental-gt-supersports-convertible-320-000>Bentley Continental GT SuperSports Convertible: $320,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Proving that Bentleys have truly captured his attention, Arnold has yet another one in his garage; this one is a powerful, sleek Continental GTC SuperSports convertible. This car boasts an impressive 6.0-liter W12 engine which cranks out 621 horsepower. Considered to be one of the most sought-after luxury cars on the market, it's not surprising that Schwarzenegger was willing to invest $320,000 to add this to his fleet.</p><h2 id=mercedes-benz-unimog-369-000>Mercedes-Benz Unimog: $369,000</h2><p>The Mercedes-Benz Unimog, owned by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is one of the most unique-looking vehicles in his garage.

It's a short-cab that rides on top of 22-inch wheels that have enormous, oversized Michelin XZL 445/65 rubber. This was $369,000 well spent, considering how rare this head-turner really is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mercedes-benz-sls-amg-roadster-540-000>Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Roadster: $540,000</h2><p>Switching gears to a vehicle that packs some punch when it comes to gorgeous styling and speedy performance, Schwarzenegger also happens to be the proud owner of a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Roadster.
