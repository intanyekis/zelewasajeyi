Some of the shows she has appeared on throughout her career include&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Empire, Making the Cut, Ready To Wear,&nbsp;and more. In more recent years, however, the 53-year-old has embraced a more meaningful title: being a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>proud mother</a>.

In May 2021, the UK native took to Instagram to surprise her millions of fans and announce that she had welcomed her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first child</a> – a daughter. At the time, she shared a since-deleted photo of her holding her little one’s feet. “A beautiful little blessing has chosen me to be her mother,” the then 50-year-old wrote in the caption. “So honoured to have this gentle soul in my life. There are no words to describe the lifelong bond that I now share with you, my angel. There is no greater love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Following the arrival of her daughter, 2, (whose name is not publicly known) the runway legend appeared on the cover of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue UK&nbsp;</a>with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter in her arms</a> for the Feb. 2022 issue. At the time, the chic momma noted that her daughter, then nine mos., loves to be a jet-setter like Naomi. “I’m lucky my little one loves to travel like me – no whimpering taking off or landing,” she explained. “She’s a good girl: she sleeps very well, she hardly ever cries and I’m told she’s very alert for her age. She’s just started waving, which is fun. She laughs a lot. She’s almost talking.” The starlet is famously private about the details around her two-year-old’s birth, however she did reveal that, “She wasn’t adopted – she’s my child.”</p><h2>Naomi Campbell’s Son</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Naomi-Campbell-kids-ig-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Just two years after Naomi became a mother for the first time in her life, she decided to expand her family once more. On Jun. 29, 2023, she took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to announce the arrival of her son. “My little darling, know that you are cherished beyond measure and surrounded by love from the moment you graced us with your presence. A True Gift from God, blessed !

She told&nbsp;Vogue UK in 2022 that, having a child is the “biggest blessing” of her life. “I can count on one hand the number of people who knew that I was having her,” she said of announcing her first child’s arrival. “But she is the biggest blessing I could ever imagine. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although the fashionista’s children came as a surprise to many, in her heart, Naomi always knew this was her destiny. “I always knew that one day I would be a mother, but it’s the biggest joy I could ever imagine. I’m <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lucky to have her</a> and I know that,” she told the outlet one year after her daughter’s birth.

I know that in relationships I have to compromise.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>She was previously engaged to U2 member <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Adam Clayton</strong></a> in 1993 and businessman <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Flavio Briatore</strong></a> before their breakup in 2002, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>.
