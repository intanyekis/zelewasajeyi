Known for multiple top hits, each musician is well known in the entertainment industry, and has been honored with numerous accolades over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Twitter has spoken, and the musician they believe is the best is Wonder! Users have come up with a variety of reasons why he is the best. Many have said he cannot be compared to others, while some have even called him the GOAT (greatest of all time). Although there were a lot of opinions, there were three that were tweeted by users the most regarding why the "Signed, Sealed, Delivered" singer is the best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It may come as a surprise for some when someone says they don't know who an artist is. However, it is not uncommon, and multiple users have admitted they have never heard of Nicks. The female artist became popular for her solo work, even though she gained her fame for being one of the lead vocalists of <a href=#>Fleetwood Mac</a>. Most of the time, people think of the names of bands rather than the names of singers in the bands, which may be a contributing factor in this reason.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Stevie Nicks Praises Harry Styles' Album... Compares It To Hers</a></span></p><p>Another reason involves her voice. Nicks is a vocalist who has a memorable voice, a voice where one knows it's her or Fleetwood Mac whenever she sings. No matter how known a singing voice may be, some people may not be fans of it. In this case, users have brought up that her voice is flat, and not as good as Wonder's. However, users such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Jayne tweeted</a> that Nicks is a good songwriter, making up for what they find wrong in her voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last but not least, Twitter has mentioned that Wonder has been a great representation of music, and has done a lot for African Americans. Being an African American himself, the singer was known to be the man who helped drive R&B into the album era. He is also an inspiration to several African Americans artists, including <a href=#>Kanye West</a>.</p><p>He's also been praised as an activist for political causes. He created a 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a federal holiday in the U.S, and released the single "Happy Birthday" to popularize it. It became a holiday in 1983, and became observed in 1986.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wonder has released many hits that are still known today, including "Superstition" and "Isn't She Lovely." The singer has won more than twenty <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a>, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The singer was also named a United Nations Messenger of Peace, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><p>Unlike Wonder, Nicks has not won any Grammy Awards as a solo artist. However, Fleetwood Mac won a Grammy Award in 1978, and the group later received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2003. As of this publication, the singer holds the record for most nominations for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance without a win.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus Collaborates with Stevie Nicks on a Remix Version of 'Midnight Sky'</a></span></p><p>Both musicians are continuing to release new music from time to time. Nicks is also continuing to work with Fleetwood Mac. Music by Wonder, Nicks, and Fleetwood Mac are all available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Truth About Stevie Wonder And Kai Morris' Expensive Divorce</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbymv4ytrqKspJq%2Fbq%2FHqKasnV2owabCyJ5ksKeembKzec6vnKtlo6myt7XEZqWim5uofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
