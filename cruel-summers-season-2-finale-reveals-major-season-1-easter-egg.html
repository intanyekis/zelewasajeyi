Fellow student Jeanette Turner (<a href=#><strong>Chiara Aurelia</strong></a>) was accused of knowing about Kate’s whereabouts but keeping it a secret. In the final scene of the first season it was revealed that <a href=#>Jeanette was aware that Kate was held captive</a> in their vice principal Martin Harris’ (<strong>Blake Lee</strong>) basement.</p><p>Viewers were in for <a href=#>an even bigger shakeup when Freeform confirmed that Cruel Summer</a> would continue as an anthology series in season 2. The hit series returned with new episodes in June, which focused on a tumultuous friendship between Megan and Isabella (<a href=#><strong>Lexi Underwood</strong></a>). Their <a href=#>love triangle with Luke Chambers (<strong>Griffin Gluck</strong>)</a> — as well as his eventual death — have been at the center of the mystery.</p><p>Before the premiere of season 2, executive producer <strong>Michelle Purple</strong> teased that the characters were all part of the same universe.</p><p>“We took into big consideration [that] people really loved the cast in season 1 and were connected to them,” she told TVLine in June. “We actually opened up a room and discussed, ‘What does it look like to continue both these girls’ stories or one of these girl’s stories?’”</p><p>Purple added: “We’re playing in the same world in the sense of it’s just a few years later. So there’s a tie to season 1, but we’re not going to tell you [what it is]! You guys have to find it!”</p><p>That same month, Stanley, 21, and Underwood, 19, offered a glimpse at the conversations that <a href=#>took place between them and the season 1 cast.</a></p><p>“It was just incredible being able to have the team from season 1 that definitely understood that formula and that structure of it. Because it is a little bit tricky navigating telling a story while also playing three different versions of your character or having those three different timelines,” Underwood exclusively told Us Weekly. “Being able to have them guide us — it kind of took the pressure off of feeling like we had to do better. Like [we had to] top something or live up to certain standards. When we do interact with [the season 1 cast], they’re all just so incredibly great and they’ve given us so much like support and love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Stanley, for her part, praised Aurelia, 20, and Holt, 25, for the advice they gave<a href=#> after starring in Cruel Summer.</a></p><p>“Chiara and Olivia have both been so, so supportive and so lovely and reached out to both of us,” Stanley shared with Us. “I had met Chiara a couple of times [and] she’s lovely. Olivia came to set one day while we were filming in Vancouver and she’s awesome.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqrrZWherTBzKacq6tdqLKiv86nZGtllp67orjEZqmerpWWubR5zJqhqKpdqLKiv86nZGpllZbAtbHRZpygn18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
