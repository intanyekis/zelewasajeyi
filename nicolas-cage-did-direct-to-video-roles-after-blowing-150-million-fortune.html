He admitted to GQ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he took the direct-to-video roles to stabilize his financial situation</a>—which had spiraled out of control.</p><p>"The phone stopped ringing. It was like, 'What do you mean we're not doing National Treasure 3? It's been 14 years. Why not?' Well, 'Sorcerer's Apprentice didn't work, and Ghost Rider didn't really sell tickets. And Drive Angry, that just came and went.'"</p><p>Cage admits that he blew through his $150 million fortune, his debt spiraled, and he&nbsp;owed&nbsp;the IRS millions of dollars and other creditors&nbsp;millions more.
