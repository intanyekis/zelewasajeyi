And my kids love asking him for advice on shoes and clothes and all that good stuff.”</p><p>As their relationship grows stronger, Larsa and her boyfriend, who is the son of NBA legend <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>, have teased the possibility of tying the knot. A source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> in August 2023 that “Marcus gave Larsa a promise ring” and that the pair were “talking marriage at the moment.” That same month, Marcus seemingly hinted that a wedding <a href=#>was in the works</a> by telling reporters in L.A., “We’re looking for a location.”</p><p>Larsa, for her part, told Us on Thursday that she is “comfortable” with where the pair’s relationship currently stands. “I like being married,” she continued. “I feel like I like having a partner, someone you can grow with, someone you can build with. I definitely like that feeling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RHOM-s-Larsa-Pippen-Reveals-if-She-Wants-More-Kids-With-Marcus-Jordan.jpg><p>Larsa and Marcus were “best friends” before they began dating, which is why she thinks they’re still going strong. “We saw each other at a party, and we did kind of look at each other. We were intrigued by each other, but we were just friends for a long time,” she recalled of when they met. “We ended up exchanging numbers and we spoke for three years just as friends. He would FaceTime me when I would be on dates. I would FaceTime him when he was [on dates]. We were just friends.”</p><p>The couple recently put their relationship to the test on <a href=#>season 2</a> of Peacock’s The Traitors, which sees celebrities compete for a cash prize while trying to discover who is sabotaging the competition from within.</p><p>“It was fun being able to go there with [Marcus],” Larsa told Us. “And we went there as a couple, and I think people thought we would have each other’s back because we’re a couple. But we had this huge conversation before we got to Scotland and we’re like, ‘Look, we’re individual[s] once we get there. We both want to win. We’re both very competitive, so good luck.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RHOM-s-Larsa-Pippen-Explains-Why-She-Froze-Her-Eggs-for-Marcus-Jordan-inline.jpg><p>Noting that she is “obsessed” with the show’s host, <strong>Alan Cumming</strong>, Larsa claimed she “knew who the traitors were within five minutes of [Alan] choosing” them, adding, “I wish the other cast members listened though.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Miami airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.
