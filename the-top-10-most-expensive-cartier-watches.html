The company actually began in 1847 when Louis Francois Cartier took over the Paris jewelry workshop located at 29 Rue Montorgueil of his mentor, Adolphe Picard. The endorsement of the English monarch propelled Cartier to fame who was regularly sought after by European royalty.</p><p>Cartier has always been known for his tradition of innovation in making timekeeping apparatuses. He was the first one to design miniature movements in the 1920s. This became considered as a landmark in the technology of making watches. After more than a century and a half of achievement in designing watches, the company has maintained the legacy of its founder by creating updated generations of modern watches.
