The unique premise of the reality TV program follows five couples dealing with an ex who is still complicatedly connected to and very much a part of their daily lives.</p><p>Among the cast are Loren Kirk, Roy Kirk, Roy’s ex-wife<a href=#> April Kirk</a>, and <a href=#>John Kirk</a>, Loren’s ex-husband.</p><p>And here’s a Loren Kirk Wiki writing which in detail explains the couple’s situation as a big blended family.</p><p><strong>Read Next:<a href=#> Sha’Carri Richardson Boyfriend, Gender, A Man, Mother</a></strong></p><h3><strong>[You, Me & My Ex] Loren Kirk Age, Birthday</strong></h3><p>Loren Kirk’s profile on Wife’s Tales&nbsp;mentioned Loren to be “32 years young” before Oct. 2020. At the time, one could not tell when exactly she celebrated her birthday.</p><p>Loren happens to have started on multiple business ventures with her ex-husband’s current wife April Kirk. And Wife’s Tales is among them. It is a blog Loren and April run together sharing their real-life journey through their “divorces, co-parenting, and chaos.”</p><h3><strong>[You, Me & My Ex] Loren Kirk Maiden Name, Family</strong></h3><p>Loren was born in San Antonio, Texas but grew up in the small town of Powder Springs in Georgia.</p><p>Years after her separation from ex-husband John and Loren still did not let go of his last name. That is the reason why her maiden name stayed a mystery.</p><p>Loren Kirk grew up the oldest of eight children from two blended families. She described her upbringing as the “oh-so-pleasant honors of the oldest, roughly translated into being the Guinea Pig for all my parent’s hair-brained ideas on disciplining and raising a highly spirited child.”</p><p>Thus, growing up, Loren revealed she really broke the molds for her younger siblings.</p><p>More about Loren’s family— Loren’s mom is friends with April’s mom and Loren has a grandmother named Carol J Nichols. Now, living in New Braunfels, Texas, she went to San Antonio College and worked as a certified pharmacy technician at CVS pharmacy.</p><h3><strong>Her Height, Weight</strong></h3><p>Loren Kirk is below 5’7” tall in height and weighed above 55 kg (until recently).

She graduated college from the University of Missouri at the age of twenty-eight. There, she received B.S. in Health Sciences with a minor in Psychology. But she herself claimed they mean “absolutely nothing” as they never came in handy to her.</p><p>Instead, after graduation, Loren landed a job in home building and has been working in the industry ever since. “What started as a job, has quickly become a career I see for myself far into the future.”</p><p>Besides, she is also involved with April on their podcast, Co-Parenting Past Chaos.
