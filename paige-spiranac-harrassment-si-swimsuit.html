The semi-pro golfer, who was&nbsp;dissed by the LPGA, for basically being too pretty, has just landed a featured spot in the coveted 2018 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Spiranac looks absolutely stunning in the shots released so far, and she’s using her platform for a good cause.</p><p>Along with the bikini pics, 24-year old Spiranac shares a devastating, personal story with SI. She details how depressed she became after playing in her first pro tournament in the Dubai Ladies European Tour, of 2015.&nbsp;She says that she was completely devastated, to the point where she was all balled up on the floor and crying. She says she was humiliated, blackmailed, slut-shamed, and <a href=#>even received death threats</a>. She says she was constantly harassed for wearing banal outfits, like a tank top and skirt, which other female golfers wore without any backlash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was receiving death threats, people were invading my privacy, I was being blackmailed. This was going on whilst I was trying to play,” she said. You can see her entire <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confession video on SI.com</a>. The woman is in tears, giving the most heartfelt description of her feelings.</p><p>Spiranac’s story didn’t end in Dubai, though, she picked herself up off of the floor, and has become a champion in the battle against hate. Paige is an ambassador for <a href=#>Cybersmile</a>, an organization to prevent cyber-bullying. She says that sometimes kids can’t just turn-off the social media, and instead they need to learn how to deal with it.</p><p><strong>PREVIOUSLY: <a href=#>RONDA ROSEY BARES IT ALL IN SI SWIMSUIT EDITION</a></strong></p><p>Paige’s Instagram account (@_paige.renee) has 1.3M followers, and constantly offers up confidence-building advice, as well as a ton of remarkable images. The golfer will post a pic of herself in tight clothes, but the caption gives details of a workout regimen. So, while the haters blame her for exploiting her good looks, she genuinely wants to help people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It hasn’t always been such a beautiful life for Spiranac. She admitted that she used to be quite a tomboy. Not entirely by choice, though. She had a rare disease that made her hair fall out, so she looked like a boy. The teasing she endured back then, helps her further relate to the kids who suffer from bullying today.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>THE BEST SI SWIMSUIT CASTING CALL SHOTS</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yxrcignGaroJ6%2ForrAnGShmaKnrrS%2FzJ6lrWWjnnq0w8imqq6hpGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
