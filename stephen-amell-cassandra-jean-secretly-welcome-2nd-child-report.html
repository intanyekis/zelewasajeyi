Comes by it naturally.”</p><p>Stephen commented, “Bowen Auguste Amell, May 13, 2022 — He has made our family and my life complete.”</p><p class=p1><strong>Original story:</strong> Another cutie for <a href=#><strong>Stephen Amell</strong></a>! The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Arrow</a>&nbsp;</i>alum and his wife,<a href=#> <strong>Cassandra Jean Amell</strong></a>, have welcomed their second child together.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><i>People&nbsp;</i></a>reported on Saturday, June 11, that the married couple — who wed in 2012 — <a href=#>secretly welcomed Baby No. 2 last month</a> in Los Angeles. <a href=#>TMZ</a> was first report the news, noting that Stephen, 41, and Cassandra, 36, are proud parents to newborn Bowen.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Heels&nbsp;</i>actor previously announced in October 2013 that the twosome <a href=#>welcomed their first child</a>, daughter Maverick.</p><p class=p1>“She came just in time for Amell Wednesdays,” the Canada native wrote via Facebook at the time, sharing a snap of himself holding his little girl in the hospital room while&nbsp;<i>The Tomorrow People&nbsp;</i>— starring his cousin <a href=#><strong>Robbie Amell</strong> </a>— aired on television.</p><p class=p1>Stephen and the former&nbsp;<a href=#><i>America’s Next Top Model&nbsp;</i></a>contestant continued to <a href=#>balance parenting their little girl amid their busy acting careers</a> before he <a href=#>decided to end his run as the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen</a> after 8 seasons on the DC Comics TV show.</p><p class=p1>“A large part of this decision [to end the CW show] is because I’m now a father and a husband and a lot of my life and interests don’t really reside in Vancouver anymore and thinking that’s the best thing for me personally and professionally,” the&nbsp;<i>Heels&nbsp;</i>actor explained in a March 2019 Facebook Live interview, ahead of <a href=#>the January 2020 series finale</a>.</p><p class=p1>Stephen later opened up exclusively to&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>about his time in the Arrowverse and how it correlated to his early courtship with the Texas native.</p><p class=p1>“When I got the job as Green Arrow/Oliver Queen, I was at a really interesting point in my life. I was dating a young lady who’s now my wife,” he <a href=#>previously told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in August 2021</a>. “I was ready for that opportunity. You’ve got to believe that there are forces in the universe that are working that you’re not aware of.”</p><p class=p1>The couple’s relationship made headlines late last year after Stephen was <a href=#>escorted off a plane in June following an alleged altercation</a> with Cassandra.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I had too many drinks in a public place, and I got on a plane,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Vampire Diaries</i></a>&nbsp;alum <a href=#>explained during an August 2021 appearance on the “Inside of You with Michael Rosenbaum”</a> podcast. “I was pissed off about something else that had nothing to do with Cass, my wife, and I picked a fight. Just I picked a fight because I wanted to be loud and upset.”</p><p class=p1>He added: “My wife said one thing the entire time. If you don’t lower your voice, they’re going to ask you to get off the plane.’ … I referred to it as an argument between my wife and I. It was not an argument. This is 100 percent my fault. I feel like I went the better part of 10 years without being an a–hole in public. I was an a–hole in public.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasrJWltaa6jJqknqScYrCiv9KapZ2qkWK3pq3NZqqem6Kawa3FjLCcpZuforJufs2dZJygmaGxbr7EqaarrF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
