Beginning by noting that he was going against his legal counsel by speaking on the matter, Envy discussed the intent behind his venture into real estate and promoting Flip 2 DAO, his former business associate, alleged fraudster Cesar Pina’s, company.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Listen, so Ceasar and myself did seminars,” the Queens native explained. “Now the reason I did these seminars is because I wanted to uplift my community. I wanted to teach my community about real estate, things that I didn’t know when I was first buying my first home. I wanted to teach our community about investing in generational wealth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1392597944-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The radio jock reiterated that he was also a victim of Pina’s illicit business dealings and that he would never take advantage of the public in that manner. “I do understand how people feel if they gave him money because I gave him a lot of money,” he said while speaking with The Breakfast Club co-host Charlamagne Tha God.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I didn’t see a dollar of return. For anyone to say that I was involved, that’s totally not true,” Envy insisted. “I would never, I been on radio for close to 30 years, and never in my 30 years time did I do nothing but try to uplift people in different ways with a business mind. I would never take a dollar from somebody.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1341189316.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Earlier this summer, the DJ was named in a lawsuit accusing Cesar and his wife, Jennifer Pina, of defrauding investors of $1.5 million. According to the suit, plaintiffs Anthony Barone and Anthony Martinito were “convinced” by the Pinas to invest into a <a href=#>real estate project</a> in Paterson, New Jersey. Envy has maintained his innocence and claims he was never directly involved with the Pinas or their business.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch DJ Envy address the allegations against him below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m3brHNr7BmqpWWuW6x0q2YrZ1dm7%2BiwcNmmKWklZyutbXOp6pmaWJogXl8kGltamc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
