Fox</strong></a> as they stepped out for The Michael J. Fox Foundation’s A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Cure Parkinson’s event hosted in New York City on Saturday, November 11.</p><p>Long opted for a classic black suit when dressing for the event, and Bosworth matched her love. The actress elevated the classic little black dress by choosing a gown that was adorned with a silver flower. She and Long were all smiles as they posted together on the red carpet.</p><p>Saturday’s date night was Long and Bosworth’s first public outing since they got secretly married. <a href=#>Long referred to Bosworth as his “now-wife”</a> in May, while discussing how they fell in love after she visited him on set of the 2022 movie Barbarian.</p><p>“I was [in Bulgaria] while I was, like, really falling in love with my now-wife,” he revealed on his “Life Is Short” podcast at the time. “She came to visit, and I had never been comfortable with … set visits. I like to separate the relationship. But, yeah, I loved having her there, and we just had the most magical time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Justin-Long-and-Kate-Bosworth-Are-All-Smiles-During-1st-Date-Night-After-Secret-Wedding-554.jpg><p>Things between Long and Bosworth turned romantic after they met on the House of Darkness set in 2021.

(Bosworth and Polish’s <a href=#>divorce was finalized</a> in March of this year.)</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in January 2022 that Long and Bosworth had <a href=#>been together “for a few months now,”</a> a source shared at the time.</p><p>“They secretly have been on a few getaways together. They both love to travel,” the insider added, noting that the duo were “just staying low-key and private about their relationship.”</p><p>Long, for his part, explained why he wanted to keep things with <a href=#>Bosworth out of the public eye</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There’s something about it, for me, that I feel like I need to protect and keep sacred because it feels sacred,” the actor explained on <a href=#><strong>Chelsea Handler</strong></a>’s “Dear Chelsea” podcast in May 2022. “I’ve never had anything like this before; I’ve never experienced this. So, it’s something I want to protect and keep, you know?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Justin-Long-and-Kate-Bosworth-Are-All-Smiles-During-1st-Date-Night-After-Secret-Wedding-556.jpg><p>Nearly one year later, <a href=#>Long confirmed that he had proposed</a> to Bosworth.</p><p>“It was a moment where it just felt so organic and it felt connected to something very, very deeply, profoundly personal that we were going through, like, a real life change, and so it came out in a very organic way,” Long told Bosworth while discussing their engagement during an April episode of his “Life is Short” podcast, revealing that the proposal just “spilled out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq95y6iloGWRo7Fut8CtnGaan6jEsL7ToWSbnZGieqXB0aKloGWimrFur8Crp56sXZmutbGMp6CgoKRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
