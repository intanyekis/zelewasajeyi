We’re looking forward to pumpkin spice and everything nice, from colorful leaves to freshly-baked pies. We’re not in total denial though. We know there are some iffy factors that come with the changing of seasons as well.</p><p>While colder weather may mean cute layering and warm drinks, it also often means dry skin — especially when it comes to our <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lips</a>. We don’t know anyone who doesn’t deal with chapped lips in the cold, and sometimes the pain can be so intense, it hurts to even smile! There are so many useless lip balms out there, we’ve definitely considered spending big to fix the issue, but <strong>Drew Barrymore</strong> may have just seriously changed our mind!</p><p><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Dan’s CortiBalm</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$7</a> at Amazon!
