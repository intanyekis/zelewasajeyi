Though it sounds badass from a pure, entertainment perspective, it has actually caused a lot of drama within the cast. There's <a href=#>her feud with Chrishell Stause</a>, her <a href=#>shared ex drama with Emma Hernan</a>, and an alleged bribing incident with a client so they'd stop working with Hernan. Now, <a href=#>Quinn has reportedly left The Oppenheim Group</a>, yet fans continue to debunk some of the claims she's made about herself including her experience as a bullied kid in high school.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is 'Selling Sunset' Star Amanza Smith Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christine-quinn-s-life-before-selling-sunset>Christine Quinn's Life Before 'Selling Sunset'</h2><p>Quinn has always been vocal about her humble beginnings. In the show, she mentioned that she was bullied as a kid. She also opened up about those times in an interview with Vogue in 2020. "Life for me growing up in Dallas, Texas, was different. I had a mother who was extremely ill—she got cancer for the first time when she was 40 and a second time a year later, and since then has had multiple health issues," she told the magazine. "I loved theater and I was a really goofy, funny, silly class clown who had to drop out because I needed to be homeschooled so I could be home with my mother. It was hard because I missed the interaction of school and I had to grow up quickly."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also revealed that she doesn't have a high school diploma. "Something I've never spoken about publicly is that I don’t have a high school diploma. I'm really insecure about it. The reason I’m sharing this now is that I want people to know that there are people out there who can’t afford education or who, like me, weren’t able to finish school," she shared. "I don't want people to think that a diploma is vital in order to be successful. It was something I wanted to forget, but I think it’s important I discuss it. You can be whoever you want to be. It doesn't matter—everything else is frosting on the cake. We should take the pressure off young people and those who can’t get an education—for whatever reason—and tell them, 'Hey, it will be okay. You don't have to follow the same path as everyone else. There are always other options.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chelsea Lazkani Had Severe Concerns About Starring On 'Selling Sunset'</a></span></p><h2 id=why-fans-don-t-believe-christine-quinn-was-bullied-in-high-school>Why Fans Don't Believe Christine Quinn Was Bullied In High School</h2><p>Reddit fans recently found a yearbook photo of Quinn, and many of them think she didn't look like she was bullied. "She actually said she was bullied because all the girls wanted to her and all the boys wanted to be with her. She talks about it when she meets up with her highschool friend in season 1," a commenter recalled on the reply section. Another Redditor said: "I call BS on her being bullied I think SHE was the bully and was being called out and she alienated the whole school so she had to be [homeschooled]. I don't believe for one hot second that SHE was bullied for her looks!" Many agreed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I agree. She looks like the pretty girl in school. And her attitude now is terrible. I've seen her on shows because of her book, and it’s repeating 'just save your money,'" noted another Redditor. "Which most investors will tell you, money has to keep moving. She's dumb, spoiled and she trapped someone with money. [He'll] get tired of her nonsense." Another fan also said that "nothing she has said turned out to be true. It's sad how much she lies." They even noticed the inconsistency in her high school story. "Wasn't one of the storylines of season 1 that guy she went to high school with who wanted to take her out on a date though? How could that have happened if she dropped out in 8th grade?" one asked.</p><p>Of course, they also brought up the drastic change in Quinn's looks. "She definitely looks average compared to her Hollywood glam," wrote a fan. "No surgery, lip fillers, heavy make-up, expensive clothes… as I mentioned, people obviously change from high school to adult."

She even promotes being honest about it. "I'm all about plastic surgery truth-bearing. It's important in a world where there’s this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia," she said. "People think that [things are] real, and it’s not. I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of make-up." <a href=#>The reality star also spends $1000 a day for her makeup in the show</a>. "It's expensive to look this cheap," she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Is Chrishell Stause Using A Fake Name On 'Selling Sunset'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ytn6Kmm2Kwqb7IrKuippVivra1zadkn5mbmrFuv9OoqbJln5t6o7HIp55mmqWhuaqxw2agp2WYnrSpedKcn6innGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
