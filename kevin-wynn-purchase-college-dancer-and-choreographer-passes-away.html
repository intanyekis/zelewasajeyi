His legacy as a visionary artist, inspiring teacher, and compassionate mentor will forever resonate, continuing to influence generations of dancers and artists to come.</p><p>Nattie Trogdon&nbsp; shared a post&nbsp; on fb on the death of Kevin:</p><p>I‚Äôve written and deleted this post so many times as I don‚Äôt have the full words to encapsulate the spirit of this magnificent human ‚Äì Kevin Wynn. My beloved teacher ‚Äì an absolute force ‚Äì a resilient spirit ‚Äì a bighearted generous choreographer/dancer/friend.<br>He would sit in the lounge at Purchase after class and talk to us about life and love and his experiences as a dancer and choreographer. He‚Äôd give us advice on where we should go and what artists we should look into -he loved us so deeply and cared about our futures as artists and people. He was cheeky and sly and at times relentless in his push for us to be better dancers. I‚Äôll never forget him lovingly yelling at me in class ‚ÄúNat ‚Äì get your shit together‚Äù when I was checked out and wasn‚Äôt present and wasn‚Äôt giving it all to one of his absolutely mind-boggling combos. (If you know, you know) No one could make me get my shit together like Kev could.<br>I loved him so dearly and every time I‚Äôd return to Purchase to sub a class or teach for a semester I‚Äôd stop by and see him if only for a brief moment. I‚Äôll never forget how his eyes would light up and he‚Äôd give me the most massive full body hug ‚Äúhey girl how you doin? You good? How‚Äôs your boo? He still dancing for that Doug guy? You dancing? Making work. Good. Keep it up‚Äù<br>Kevin ‚Äì you beautiful complex wonderful kind big hearted human. I‚Äôll love you forever and ever. And I know I‚Äôm in a vast sea of people who love you so dearly and are mourning your loss right now. I wish you could‚Äôve seen what we‚Äôre making at Purchase this semester and I wish I could‚Äôve been enveloped by one of your full body hugs one more time. I think about you always ‚Äì how you held space and cared for your students. How you weren‚Äôt afraid to be vulnerable and complex and show your humanity. I‚Äôll throw some ‚Äúmonkey ears‚Äù into our work for you and know I‚Äôve gotten my shit together and it‚Äôs a big thanks to the lessons you taught me a decade ago (even if it took some time for them to sink in)<br>Rest in Peace Kevin Wynn. Thank you for everything. Holding all who loved him and shared the space with him in my heart today. üíî</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kuKbCyKdksLGeo3qxwdGcn5qrlWKwsLjLnp6eZZSWu6Sx0WaYp5xdmLWwvsSonquZoJ2ys3nPmqqsnaNirrit2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
