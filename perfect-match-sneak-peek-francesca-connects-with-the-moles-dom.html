It’s kind of a little bit frustrating that my first kiss with Dom is going to be blindfolded with earmuffs on, but he should have made a move on me sooner. This is his fault.”</p><p>Francesca recently opened up to Us about the new show, describing her “strategy” for the board as contestants can either try to break up couples, help their costars find a genuine connection or put themselves on a date with a newbie.</p><p>“I feel like all of us were pretty genuine on the board with trying to match up people that would actually make genuine connections,” Francesca exclusively told Us earlier this month. “I mean, that was my thought process anyways.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Perfect-Match-Sneak-Peek-Francesca-Declares-Best-Kisser-in-House-Amid-Connection-With-The-Moles-Dom-4.jpg><p>Selling Tampa’s <strong>Anne-Sophie Petit-Frere</strong>, meanwhile, disagreed, joking about not wanting Too Hot to Handle’s <strong>Georgia Hassarati</strong> to ever enter the villa.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My strategy was a little different. When I went in the boardroom, I’m sorry, Georgia, but I was like, ‘Oh, she’s too hot. Like, let’s not bring her to the house. Nope! We don’t need that,’” she quipped. “‘I need time to get to know people. Let’s leave Georgia at home.’”</p><p>Perfect Match debuts on Netflix Tuesday, February 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeeqpaasLV5zJqrnKBdqLumrcpmp56dm2Kzs63NnJysm5FisLC6zZ6aratdrLa1tIytn55lnaS5pr%2BMnaamZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
