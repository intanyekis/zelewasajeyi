He needs mental help,” Nash said. “This is mental health. When it becomes destructive, when there’s a chance this costs you millions of dollars and you just continue to push and push and push?</p><p>“I’ll tell you right now, if I would have broke in and saw some motherfucker doing that shit,” Nash explained, “I would have said, ‘Oh if he can get away with that, well fuck, then I’m going to do it.”</p><p>Nash continued, stating that Tony Khan should bring in an authority figure to deal with behavior like this.</p><h2 id=h-bring-in-a-heater>Bring In A Heater</h2><p>“I just think that Tony Khan needs to get somebody there to be the heater. He needs to bring somebody in if he’s not going to [deal with it himself]. Vince [McMahon] wouldn’t put up with that shit,” Nash said. “It’s disrespect to Tony. And Tony’s not that [confrontational guy]. To me, Punk is almost a bully at this point because he knows that Tony is not, that’s just not in his DNA.”</p><p>Oliver asked Nash if he, in Tony Khan’s position, would unequivocally fire Punk.</p><p>“Yeah,” Nash stated. “My whole thing is this. If you can’t go out in front of 80,000 people and f*ckin’ forget about everything and just do what you do, especially with that far of a walk to the ring? It’s like, no matter what happens, even if Sandusky got a hold of you in the shower, I still think you could shake it off by the time you get to the ring in front of 80,000 people.”</p><p>*This episode was released Monday morning but was recorded prior to CM Punk being terminated on September 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNpaGtxZ2K4psLIp2SnmaOdeqS5jKmsp6NdorKvwMClZKGdkaHBqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
