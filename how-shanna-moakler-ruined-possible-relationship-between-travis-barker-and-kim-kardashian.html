In the previous season, the latter distanced herself from the family, saying: "With my family, I'm like, 'Protect my energy.' And like, 'I'm married! Bye everyone!'"</p><p>Prior to that, she broke down during a conversation with Kendall Jenner. "I feel like there's an abundance of opportunities," she said of Kim's "copied" Dolce & Gabbana collection. "It's not about business, it's just there's so much and it takes precedence over hurting your sister. It's legit copying my wedding."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall said that she could see "both sides" of the situation after Kourtney said that what Kim did "was more personal. I think that's why it hurts my feelings because it was my actual wedding." Kim's catty response went viral with people calling it a first-world problem.</p><p>"I got married in Italy. Am I saying you copied me by getting married in Italy?" she said in a confessional interview. "Who performed at my wedding? Andrea Bocelli. Who performed at Kourtney's wedding? Andrea Bocelli. You stole my f--king wedding country and my wedding performer. Andrea Bocelli is my favorite male singer of all time, but I'm copying her dolce vita lifestyle? OK."</p><p>The two are on good terms for now after a serious one-on-one talk. But in a recent episode, Kim admitted that they had a group chat called "Not Kourtney." When asked about the members of the group, Kourtney said in her Instagram comments: "I believe it was just my sisters from the surveys I've been taking."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kim-kardashian-wore-uncharacteristically-modest-outfit-as-kanye-and-bianca-censori-cause-outrage-with-nsfw-outfits.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Now That She Has An "In" With Disney, Will Kim Kardashian Work With Marvel?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kim Kardashian's acting in American Horror Story is drawing attention, but could it lead to big opportunities with Disney's Marvel?</span><h2 id=did-travis-barker-date-kim-kardashian>Did Travis Barker Date Kim Kardashian?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/untitled-design-49.jpg><p>In an episode of The Kardashians, <strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong> told Kourtney that the <strong><a href=#>musician</a> </strong>moved to Calabasas to be close to her. Fans then reminded the internet that <a href=#>Travis dated Kim in 2007</a>, the year he moved to the neighborhood. He even called the former Mrs. <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong> "f------ hot" and "eye candy" after saying he had a huge "crush" on her.</p><p>In his 2016 memoir, Can I Say: Living Large, Cheating Death, and Drums, Drums, Drums, Travis wrote that during a 2006 trip to Amsterdam with his then-girlfriend, Paris Hilton, he was secretly eyeing Kim who was working as the socialite's closet organizer back then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was having a blast and was happy to let the world know it. I kept on secretly checking out Kim, telling Lil Chris [drum tech], 'I don't care if she's the closet girl, she's hot,'" he wrote in the book. They then started talking after Kim's infamous sex tape.</p><p>Travis recalled being a "gentleman" to her despite her reputation at that time. "I'd go visit her and her family at their clothing store," he said of their wholesome affair. "We'd be really sweet around each other, like little kids, and then when we were apart, she'd call me and say, 'I want to see you again.' 'Me too,' I'd say."</p><p>However, he eventually got back with <a href=#>his ex-wife Shanna Moakler</a> who "caught wind of what was going on. She poured a drink on Kim at a party thrown by Carmen Electra. I felt terrible," said the punk rocker. Travis then clarified that he and Kim "never touched each other. It just wasn't meant to be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/khloe-kardashian-says-scott-disick-hit-rock-bottom-as-kourtney-prepares-to-welcome-baby-with-travis-barker.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Khloe Kardashian Says Scott Disick Hit Rock Bottom As Kourtney Prepares To Welcome Baby With Travis Barker</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Not only is Scott Disick still struggling with Kourtney Kardashian moving on, but he was recently in a serious car accident.</span><h2 id=what-does-travis-barker-think-about-kim-and-kourtney-39-s-feud>What Does Travis Barker Think About Kim And Kourtney's Feud?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar51978540.jpg><p>Travis hasn't made any public statement on Kim and Koutney's feud. But the couple seem to be focused on their own family these days. In September 2023, the drummer postponed his tour as his wife had an <a href=#>emergency fetal surgery</a>. In a lengthy Instagram post, Kourtney announced that everything went well with the operation.</p><p>"I will be forever grateful to my incredible doctors for saving our baby's life," she wrote back then. "I am eternally grateful to my husband who rushed to my side from tour to be with me in the hospital and take care of me afterwards, my rock. And to my mom, thank you for holding my hand through this."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "I don't think anyone who hasn't been through a similar situation can begin to understand that feeling of fear. I have a whole new understanding and respect for the mamas who have had to fight for their babies while pregnant. Praise be to God. Walking out of the hospital with my baby boy in my tummy and safe was the truest blessing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqLWius2aZKankaC5pr6Mq6yippWZerG70qygm6SVYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnBnquwnZWjerW%2BwK%2BgrGWSlr%2BssdFmmKecXaC2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
